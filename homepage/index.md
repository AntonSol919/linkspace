```definition
Supernet  [ˈsü-pərˌnet]
A self-referential multi-user data organization protocol whose primary
addressing method uses hashes instead of endpoint identifiers.
A communication protocol where the method of exchange is an extraneous concern.
e.g. git, bitcoin, nostr, the linkspace protocol
```

In a supernet anybody can talk _about_ data, instead of talking _at_ a server.

[The Linkspace Protocol](https://antonsol919.github.io/linkspace/index.html)  is supernet with the following highlights:
- Small and powerful API
- Fast (Blake3, no JSON/Base64 encoding, well aligned fields)
- Path (URL like) addressable packets.
- Group/Domain split
