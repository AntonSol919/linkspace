<h1 id="explain-like-im-5">Explain Like I’m 5</h1>
<p>This document is a simplified view of our web and how the linkspace
protocol will change it. The title is “Explain like i’m 5” but this is a
lie. 5 year olds will not know enough about the world to understand.
Somewhere between 15 and 40 should do. Still a challange; The 15 year
old would be confused by analogies about printers or papers. The 40y old
has mastered the skill of “print to pdf” and resists learning anything
new.</p>
<p>The concepts described here should improve how you understand the
digital world. Its both a over simplification, and still difficult . But
I believe it is the minimum you <em>need</em> in order to understand
what the digital world <em>is</em> and where we can take it. The
consequences are for yourself to figure out.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-our-current-web-work">How does our current web
work?</h2>
<p>There are hosts; systems that provide information.<br />
There are guests; you in an app or the webbrowser.</p>
<p>A host has setup a process on a computer. It will receive new
information every now and then. This data is saved in order of receiving
it.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alice shares a new image</li>
<li>Bob wants to buy a car</li>
<li>Charlie is advertising spam</li>
<li>Dave opened our app</li>
<li>Alice is looking for a taxi</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, in the dark holes off the silicon where we trapped lighting to
dance to our whims an idea will power on.<br />
The exact idea is is irrelevant.<br />
We’re interested in the general outline.<br />
What they have in common is they
<code>read_index &lt;-&gt; process &lt;-&gt; insert_index</code>;<br />
and interact with other ideas doing the same.</p>
<h2 id="the-index">The index</h2>
<p>If you ever worked with files and folders you know the basics.<br />
An index looks something like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Path</th>
<th>Data</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>/work/file1</td>
<td>Hello world</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>/work/presentation</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>/work/otherfile</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>/work/subdir/file2</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>/private/file1</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>/private/file2</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The <code>read_index</code> reads /work/file1 and returns
<code>Hello world</code>.<br />
Your device might automatically pick a program to open the data
with.<br />
But you can pick different programs, the data itself stays the same.</p>
<p><code>read_index</code> can also read /hello/ and return:</p>
<pre><code>[file1,presentation,otherfile,subdir/file2]</code></pre>
<p>The things text “/hello/file1” and “/world/file2” go by many names.
Paths, urls, Identifiers, channels, etc. The important thing is they
allow us to organize in a hierachy of sorted names. Its a useful middle
ground between how computers work and how humans think. I will call it a
path.</p>
<p>The events the host receivs and writes down are also written to the
index.<br />
They are simply in order and flat.<br />
It is flat and ordered by time:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Path</th>
<th>Data</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>log/event0000</td>
<td>Alice shares a new image</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>“log/event0001</td>
<td>Bob wants to buy a car</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>log/event0002</td>
<td>Charlie is advertising spam</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>log/event0003</td>
<td>Dave oepened our app</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>log/event0004</td>
<td>Alice is looking for a taxi</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="in-the-loop">In The Loop</h2>
<p>Now that you know what an index is we can talk about the
<code>read_index &lt;-&gt; process &lt;-&gt; write_index</code>
loop.</p>
<p>A process:</p>
<ul>
<li>will wait for something to happen to the index,</li>
<li>do [read_index] any number of times,</li>
<li>combine and [process] the data,</li>
<li>do [write_index] any number of times.</li>
<li>return to wait</li>
</ul>
<p>A typical process is a utility for others. It creates commonly used
sorted lists in the index. This makes it faster and easy to find
specific stuff. They might create:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Path</th>
<th>Data</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>/by-person/alice/event0000</td>
<td>Alice shares a new image</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>/by-person/alice/event0004</td>
<td>Alice is looking for a taxi</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>/log-without-spam/event0000</td>
<td>Alice shares a new image</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>/log-without-spam/event0001</td>
<td>Bob wants to buy a car</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>/log-without-spam/event0003</td>
<td>Dave opened our app</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>/log-without-spam/event0003</td>
<td>Alice is looking for a taxi</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Note that its common to think of “moving” or “deleting” paths from
the index.<br />
If you take one thing away it should be this:<br />
The index is explicity <strong>NOT</strong> about “moving” or “deleting”
entries. We can pretend to do so in various ways. But they do not
translate well to reality. By assuming it is possible to “move” and
“delete” we miscommunicate about what is happening. We invented them in
a different time for a different world.</p>
<p>The closest real ability is to “forget”. Be warned that in a network
it is hard to forget. The effect of “moving” or “deleting” are achieved
by creating new entries. For instance, “log-without-spam” is a copy of
“log” without “event0002”.</p>
<p>This <code>read_index &lt;-&gt; process &lt;-&gt; write_index</code>
loop describes the hosts you know.</p>
<ul>
<li>Timelines</li>
<li>Popularity ranking / recommendation lists</li>
<li>Supply and demand for price calulations</li>
<li>Find the result for your search.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-graphical-user-interface">The graphical user interface</h2>
<p>Talking to the host is done in arcane incantations, channeled through
lightning, hidden from view. For guests like us, the browser and apps
paint the shapes we like. With them we interact with the index of the
host.</p>
<p>It feel as a ‘place’.<br />
People naturally care about the place.<br />
Less so the hidden lightning.<br />
We’ve come to see them as one whole.</p>
<p>But they are two different things.<br />
In theory we as guests can split the two.<br />
Take one experience and use it elsewhere.<br />
We’ve sadly stopped doing that.<br />
In part because the hosts want to have their place in and between our
lives.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-hash">What is a Hash?</h2>
<p>A hash function reads something and creates a very big number.<br />
The number is special.<br />
If we both get the same number, we have read the same data.</p>
<p>This is useful when we want to talk about data. It is a unique name
for things. This way computers can compare things.</p>
<p>It is the difference between sending:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gigabytes of a video to compare locally</li>
<li><code>Have you seen BmtvS303a3hcPF2OvtCcNAna0mW1mwUzgyGgSB84tZU ?</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Large hosts do this all the time. They use multiple computers all
over the world to make things faster. It is too expensive for those
computers to agree on the order that things happen. But they can agree
on the hash of what happened.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-public-key">What is a public key?</h2>
<p>Most hosts provide a guests with accounts.<br />
It identifies you to the host.<br />
Its very simple to impleent if nobody can access the index.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Path</th>
<th>Data</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>/account/alice/pass</td>
<td>&lt;password&gt;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>/account/alice/email</td>
<td>..</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>/account/alice/phone</td>
<td>..</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>/account/bob/pass</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>/account/charlie/pass</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Alice can proof herself to the host, and so can bob.<br />
But this is archaic in two ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are sending the host the password when we register</li>
<li>When alice and bob want to talk, this <em>specific</em> host has to
<em>always</em> be there and validate their identity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Public key cryptography provides a math solution. Anybody at anytime
can run an algorithm to pick two numbers. A (PrivateKey, PublicKey)
pair. If you do it right, you will not pick the same number twice before
the sun explodes ( give or take a few big bangs )</p>
<p>The private key can create ‘signatures’ that proof that they were
present when the public key was created. Without the private key you can
<em>not</em> proof that you have created a public key.</p>
<p>With public key cryptography: - The host no longer receives your
secret password. - If alice and bob want to talk, they need to share
public keys once through <em>any</em> host at <em>any</em> time in the
past.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-the-linkspace-protocol">What is the Linkspace
Protocol?</h1>
<p>Now that we know about the index, hashes, and public keys, we can
talk about the future of the internet. In linkspace all events:</p>
<ul>
<li>are hashed,</li>
<li>have a group</li>
<li>have a domain</li>
<li>can have a path,</li>
<li>can be signed with a public key.</li>
</ul>
<p>The hash is generated: It allows everybody to talk about things
without ambiguity. The group is added from context, it signals the
people you intent to share with ( for example the #:pub public group )
The domain is chosen by a developer. It is put before the path. It
signals what interface to use and what the paths mean. The path is set
by a domain application, so others can interact with events. The
signature is created from the user’s public key. It allows us to
identify eachother.</p>
<h2 id="consequences">Consequences</h2>
<p><code>read_index</code> and <code>write_index</code> are
democratized.</p>
<p>Hosting the index is no longer special.<br />
The user interface could operate in any group.<br />
No lockin, no lockout.</p>
<p>That is not to say everything is shared all the time.<br />
A [process] might be done by a dedicated systems.<br />
Special groups can be made with specific sharing rules.<br />
The user interface can set constraints.</p>
<p>However the public hosts that are just a place to share what guests
create are fucked. Instead of dictating rules, they must compete. Guests
can move to a better host and still talk with the people they know.</p>
<p>We might even combine guest systems and be our own hosts.</p>
