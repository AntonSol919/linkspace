# Why?{#why}

This protocol came to be for two reasons.

Reason 1: I found it overly complex to build multi-user systems.

For every 'N' networked applications someone uses, they have to create 'M' groups.
This creates N*M configuration.
In theory linkspace makes this an N+M problem.

A group, once set up can run a domain application.
A domain application can run in any group.

Or put more practically:
The users can use a chat app to talk to a group and open a different app to play a game with that same group.

Similarly, from a developer's perspective, building something new can be fun.
Building something new and having to build and manage servers, user accounts, groups, etc is a lot less fun.

[Reason 2]{#reason2}: I wanted to have an answer to a key question that underpins how our society perceives and uses digital systems.

**Who gets to __administrate__ the cat videos, taxi service, messages, and other data we interact with online?**

As I see three options:

1. Applications are hosted by one organization on their machines. This is how most of the internet currently works.
2. A pay2play scheme, on a blockchain.
3. Users pick their admins, on a supernet.

In Option 1, our current web, the host is the administrator.
It has unilateral control because it relays data between users.
Furthermore, many popular hosts are the result of an environment where winner keeps all.
They're built for optimal exploitation of their users.
Everything is permitted to keep it that way.
**Lock-in** the users, and **lock-out** any threat to the platform's place in your life.

You must break these locks.

[Option 2]{#option2}, blockchains.
They are hyped to be many things, and some people believe blockchains will be the foundation of our digital space going forward.
I don't see how.
They encode scarcity. Using them is made to be expensive.
Very few systems require that.
Appointing and trusting an administrator has always been cheaper and simpler.

Scarcity makes blockchains attractive for the people already invested, but these properties are antithetical to the process of development.
Successful systems are build from small incremental improvements.
That dynamic doesn't seem to take place when the building blocks are a costly chain of consent.

Option 3, a supernet like linkspace, is the option that makes more sense to me.
It splits up the hosts and doesn't encode scarcity as a core principle.

In linkspace the role of host as we know them today is split up into:

- Providing groups with servers to relay data.
- Developing domain applications that run on linkspace.

Should someone in the system abuses their position the user can decouple and change things up without losing access to their history and relations to others.
If for nothing else, a supernet is worth it to get us more useful competition.

Whether this all works out as intended, I have no idea.

My hope is we can look back at the current era of the internet and recognize it for what it is.
digital fiefdoms.
The step forward is to take full control over who lords over us.
