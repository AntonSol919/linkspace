# Why?

This protocol came to be for two reasons.
I found it overly complicated (oppose to simple - not easy) to build multiuser systems.
A project starts and ends with a vision for what the user should experience and do.
That's difficult enough.
Instead, development also has to deal with managing a server, networking, identity, and access.
In linkspace I've tried to decouple these things.
A group, once setup can run any domain app. A domain app can run in any group.

The second is to provide an answer to an issue we've all noticed in some form or another.
I see it as such;
We face a question on the rules for our the digital space. Its answer underpins how our society works:

**Who gets to __administrate__ which cat videos, taxi service, or (political) message we share and see online?**

I know three options:

1. Dedicated hosts, exclusively on their machines.
2. A pay2play scheme, on a blockchain.
3. Users pick their admins, on a supernet.

See [Basics](./basics.html) how 1 and 3 differ.

An analogy would be:
A medieval peasant wasn't entirely limited in switching between preachers.
But among the best ideas we ever had, was to have anyone read and write.

Option one is unilateral control over content.
These systems have evolved with one goal:
Optimal exploitation of the guest and their attention. Everything is permitted to keep it that way.
**lock-in** the guests, and **lock-out** any threat to the platform's place in your life.

We should break those locks.

Dedicated hosts still have a role to play.
But users only get a good deal if they _could_ walk away without losing what is already there.

The era of digital dictatorships and fiefdoms needs to end.
Normalcy of those rules as the bedrock of most communication is bad.
