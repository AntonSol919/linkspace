# Why?

This protocol came to be for two reasons.
The first is developer hubris.
I found it overly complicated (oppose to simple - not easy) to build multiuser systems.

The second is to answer a question we've all noticed by now.
I see it as such;  
People must face a question that underpins what society can be:

**Who gets to __administrate__ which cat videos, taxi service, or (political) message we share and see online?**

I know three options:

1. Dedicated hosts, exclusively on their machines.
2. A pay2play scheme, on a blockchain.
3. Users pick their admins, on a supernet.

(See [ELI5](./eli5.html) how 1 and 3 differ)

Option one is unilateral control over content with two goals:
Optimal exploitation of the guest's attention, and everything is permitted to keep it that way.
**lock-in** the guests, and **lock-out** any threat to its place in your life.

I fear the idea of liberal democratic autonomy in the public square does not survive;
in a life experienced under irreplaceable remote administration.
Privacy laws do not bar the "message of the medium".
We can break the locks.
