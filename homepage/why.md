# Why?

This protocol came to be for two reasons.

Reason 1: I found it overly complex to build multi-participant systems.

A project starts and ends with a vision for what the user should experience and do.
That's difficult enough.
Instead, development also has to deal with managing a server, networking, identity, and access.
In linkspace I've tried to decouple these things.
A group, once setup can run any domain app. A domain app can run in any group.

Reason 2: I wanted to address a key question that underpins how our society uses digital systems.

**Who gets to __administrate__ the cat videos, taxi service, messages, and other data we share and see online?**

I know three options:

1. Dedicated hosts, exclusively on their machines. This is how most of the internet currently works.
2. A pay2play scheme, on a blockchain.
3. Users pick their admins, on a supernet.


In Option 1, our current web, control over content is unilateral.
The current systems have evolved with one goal:
optimal exploitation of their users. Everything is permitted to keep it that way.
**lock-in** the users, and **lock-out** any threat to the platform's place in your life.

We should break these locks.

Dedicated hosts have a role to play.
But users can only get a good deal if they _could_ walk away without losing what is already there.

[Option 2]{#option2}, blockchains. They are hyped to be many thinks, and some people want to believe blockchains will be the foundation of our digital space going forward. I don't see how. They encodes exclusivity, scarcity, and inequality.
Very few useful systems require those things.
It makes them attractive for the people already invested, but these properties are antithetical to the process of development.
Most successful system seem to share a common history. A developer builds something simple that works, then has the freedom to tweak and optimize
for utility. That doesn't seem to happen when the building blocks require a complex chain of consent.

Option 3, the [supernet](./basics.html), is the option that makes sense. It prevents data hosts from gaining all the leverage as they have in our current system. And they don't encode scarcity or consent as a core principle in the way blockchains do.

This era of digital dictatorships and fiefdoms needs to end.
