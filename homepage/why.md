# Why?

This protocol came to be for two reasons.
I found it overly complicated (oppose to simple - not easy) to build multi-participant systems.

A project starts and ends with a vision for what the user should experience and do.
That's difficult enough.
Instead, development also has to deal with managing a server, networking, identity, and access.
In linkspace I've tried to decouple these things.
A group, once setup can run any domain app. A domain app can run in any group.

The second is to provide an answer to an issue we've all noticed in some form or another.
I see it as such;
We face a question on the rules for our the digital space. Its answer underpins how our society works:

**Who gets to __administrate__ the cat videos, taxi service, messages, and other data we share and see online?**

I know three options:

1. Dedicated hosts, exclusively on their machines.
2. A pay2play scheme, on a blockchain.
3. Users pick their admins, on a supernet.

See [Basics](./basics.html) how 1 and 3 differ.

Option one, our current web, is unilateral control over content.
These systems have evolved with one goal:
Optimal exploitation of its users. Everything is permitted to keep it that way.
**lock-in** the users, and **lock-out** any threat to the platform's place in your life.

We should break those locks.

Dedicated hosts have a role to play.
But users only get a good deal if they _could_ walk away without losing what is already there.

Blockchains are in the business of encodes exclusivity, scarcity, and inequality at its **root**.

In practice they fail to support useful systems, because such a thing starts its life as a simple prototype hacked together.
This gives the developers freedom _after_ building it to adapt it and optimize for utility.

Every property of a blockchain that make it attractive for the people invested, is antithetical to the process of development.

Supernets are the future.

This era of digital dictatorships and fiefdoms needs to end.
Normalcy of the other options as the bedrock of communication is bad.
