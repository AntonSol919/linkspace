# Why?

This protocol came to be for two reasons.

Reason 1: I found it overly complex to build multi-participant systems.

A project starts and ends with a vision for what the user should experience and do.
That's difficult enough.
Instead, development also has to deal with managing a server, networking, identity, and access.
In linkspace I've tried to decouple these things.
A group, once setup can run any domain app. A domain app can run in any group.

Reason 2: I wanted to address a key question that underpins how our society uses digital systems.

**Who gets to __administrate__ the cat videos, taxi service, messages, and other data we share and see online?**

I know three options:

1. Dedicated hosts, exclusively on their machines. This is how most of the internet currently works.
2. A pay2play scheme, on a blockchain.
3. Users pick their admins, on a supernet.


In Option 1, our current web, control over content is unilateral.
The current systems have evolved with one goal:
optimal exploitation of their users. Everything is permitted to keep it that way.
**lock-in** the users, and **lock-out** any threat to the platform's place in your life.

We should break these locks.

Dedicated hosts have a role to play.
But users can only get a good deal if they _could_ walk away without losing what is already there.

[Option 2]{#option2}, blockchains, encodes exclusivity, scarcity, and inequality.

These properties make it attractive for the people already invested, but are antithetical to the process of development. A successful system is born from a simple system. Most simple systems are hacked together to solve a problem, and a developer comes back _afterwards_ to optimize for utility.
That doesn't seem to happen when the system requires a chain of consent.

Option 3, the [supernet](./basics.html), is the option that makes sense.

This era of digital dictatorships and fiefdoms needs to end.
