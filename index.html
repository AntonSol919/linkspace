Supernet  [ˈsü-pərˌnet]<br>
A self-referential multi-participant data organization protocol whose primary
addressing method uses hashes instead of endpoint identifiers.
A communication protocol where the method of exchange is an extraneous concern.<br>
e.g. git, bitcoin, nostr, linkspace
</div>
<p>In a supernet anybody can talk <em>about</em> data, instead of
talking <em>at</em> a server.</p>
<p>A supernet is ideal when multiple participants want to own and
administrate (part of) a digital system. This is in contrast to current
technologies where users contact a single host, which acts as de facto
administrator by virtue of hosting the data.</p>
<p>Linkspace is a supernet with the following highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small and powerful API</li>
<li>Fast (Blake3, no JSON/Base64 encoding, well aligned fields)</li>
<li>Path (URL like) addressable data</li>
<li>Group/Domain split</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the <a href="#basics">Basics</a> for an introduction. <a
href="#download">Download</a> to give it a try and say hi on the test
group. Check out the <a href="./docs/guide/index.html">Guide</a> if
you're up for practical stuff.</p>
<p>The packet and database layout are stable, but that's about it.
Expect stuff to be incomplete and undocumented.</p>
<p>Any feedback, questions, and ideas for improvements are welcome!</p>
<p>Of course the preferred way is to try and contact me by downloading
the zip and sending a message to the test group. For the less
adventurous you can open an issue on github or email me at
antonsol919@gmail.com.</p>
<h1 id="basics">Basics</h1>
<p>In the 1960s we invented the electronic hierachical filesystem.
Organizing files in folders. For example
"/linkspace/homepage/index.html". This proved extremely powerful. So
much so, that the (early) Web, specifically HTTP, is essentially nothing
more than a way to talk to file systems around the world. i.e. <a
href="http://antonsol919.github.io/linkspace/index.html">"https://antonsol919.github.io/linkspace/index.html"</a>.
Linkspace takes this a step further.</p>
<p>To get an idea of what linkspace lets us do we can look at an example
of a message board. Initially it only contains someone complaing about a
coffee machine and an attached image. Someone else starts a thread about
tabs vs spaces.</p>
<p>The two are merged together to create the new state of the message
board.</p>
<div class="entrygrid small"><span></span>
<span>/image/BrokenMachine.jpg</span>
<span>[image data]</span>

<span></span>
<span>/thread/Tabs or spaces/msg</span>
<span>Are we still doing this?</span>

</div>
<p>We'll call "image/BrokenMachine.jpg" a <strong>path</strong> pointing
to [image data]. One or more of these entries, a path + data, in a
(sorted) hierachical set together we'll call a <strong>tree</strong>. We
just saw what happens when we merge trees. The internet as we know it is
built on them.</p>
<p>There are millions of hosts (i.e. servers) that serve such a tree,
receive new entries, and do some processing.</p>
<p>This is more true than might be aparent. It's not just HTTP. For
example, an SQL database is a special case of a tree. It is built on top
of multiple sorted lists under table names. Essentially their rows are
"/table<em>name/primary</em>key = value", and a SQL query can address
multiple entries.</p>
<p>My point is not to compare linkspace to HTTP or to replace SQL. I
bring them up as an argument for the unreasonable effectiveness of
organizing data in a (sorted) tree.</p>
<p>Exchanging data can be thought of as combining <strong>your
tree</strong> with <strong>another tree</strong>. We've dubbed words to
describe specific cases such as: '<strong>creating posts</strong>',
'<strong>uploading image</strong>', '<strong>upvote/like a
post</strong>', '<strong>stream a video </strong>', etc. Fundamentally
they can be viewed as merging trees, and having an application provide a
pleasant interface.</p>
<p>The majority of the internet that people interact with today follows
a single host design. A design where you make a request to get the only
'real' copy of the tree. For all its simplicity, this design has
downsides. It becomes a single point of failure, links can become
invalid, everybody has to re-invent authentication, every application
has to re-invent dealing with IO errors, etc. Additionally, there are
profound <a href="#why">consequences</a> for the dynamic between host
and user.</p>
<p>In linkspace there is no single 'real' copy, and thus no de facto
administrator. Any number of participants can host (part of) a tree.</p>
<p>That does mean there is no way to uniquely identify an entry with
only a path. Two computers far apart can write to the same location at
the same time. No one would know until their trees get merged.</p>
<p>In linkspace we allow more than one entry to have the same path. Each
entry is cryptograhpically hashed, i.e. there exists a unique number to
reference the entry.</p>

<p>An entry also carries a creation date, and <strong>can</strong> be
cryptographically signed. These cryptographic public keys look like
[b:0XITdhLAhfdIiWrdO8xYAJR1rplJCfM98fYb66WzN8c], but we can refer to
them by <a href="#LNS">lns</a> name such as [@:anton:nl].</p>
<p>An upside of using hashes, is that we can choose to link to other
data by its path (e.g. "image/BrokenMachine.jpg") or by its hash:</p>

<p>Entries in linkspace have two fields that preceed the path. A
<strong>domain</strong> field and <strong>group</strong> field.
Essentially each (domain, group) has its own tree. An application picks
a domain name to use. When running it specifies what data is required
from the group. The exchange of data happens in the background. The
application only has to deal with the tree and the new entries. It
doesn't have to manage connections.</p>
<p>The group indicates the set of intended recipients. An application
should ask the user which group to use. A group is made up by one or
more members that have set up a method of exchange.</p>

<p>These are the basic concepts. With the most notable simplification
being that: <a href="./docs/guide/index.html#lk_datapoint">Data
entries</a> without a path, group, domain, etc exists as well and
referencing other packets by hash is not done inside the data but <a
href="./docs/guide/index.html#lk_linkpoint">adjacent</a> together with a
'tag'.</p>
<p>If you're on a unix give it a <a href="#Download">try</a>. (It runs
on windows but i've not yet build method of exchanging data between
peers for it) For details on the exact layout of the tree and other
practical stuff see the <a href="./docs/guide/index.html">Guide</a>.</p>
<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>A few notes to prevent some confusion.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Is this a blockchain?<br />
<strong>A</strong>: Only if you think git is a blockchain. There are
neither 'blocks', nor a strict 'chain'. Most blockchains also have a
different set of <a href="#option2">values</a>. Which is why I'm
proposing the more general term 'supernet'.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: How would it handle unwanted content /
spam?<br />
<strong>A</strong>: Someone can sign a list of 'accepted' entries, and
you can filter based on that. Effectively emulating the current state of
affairs. Furthermore, linkspace gives us extra tools: Proof of work on
hashes, and proof of association public keys vouching for another (i.e.
friends of friends).</p>
<h1 id="why">Why?</h1>
<p>This protocol came to be for two reasons.</p>
<p>Reason 1: I found it overly complex to build multi-user systems.</p>
<p>For every 'N' applications someone uses, they have to create 'M'
groups. This creates N*M configuration. In theory linkspace makes this
an N+M problem.</p>
<p>A group, once set up can run a domain application. A domain
application can run in any group.</p>
<p>Or put more practically: The users can use a chat app to talk to a
group and open a different app to play scrabble with that same
group.</p>
<p>Similarly from a developer's perspective, building something new can
be fun. Building something new and having to build and manage a server,
user accounts, groups, etc is a lot less fun.</p>
<p>Reason 2: I wanted to address a key question that underpins how our
society uses digital systems.</p>
<p><strong>Who gets to <strong>administrate</strong> the cat videos,
taxi service, messages, and other data we share and see
online?</strong></p>
<p>As I see it there are three options:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Dedicated hosts, exclusively on their machines. This is how most of
the internet currently works.</li>
<li>A pay2play scheme, on a blockchain.</li>
<li>Users pick their admins, on a supernet.</li>
</ol>
<p>In Option 1, our current web, the host has unilateral control. The
current systems have evolved with one goal: optimal exploitation of
their users. Everything is permitted to keep it that way.
<strong>lock-in</strong> the users, and <strong>lock-out</strong> any
threat to the platform's place in your life.</p>
<p>We should break these locks.</p>
<p>I'm not suggesting they go away entirely. Most hosts provide more
than just a means to exchange data between users. They can still fill
that role. What a supernet does is create the option for users to back
out of a deal with a provider without necessarily losing all their
history and relations with others. If for nothing else, a supernet would
be worth it for the competition it enables.</p>
<p><span id="option2">Option 2</span>, blockchains. They are hyped to be
many things, and some people believe blockchains will be the foundation
of our digital space going forward. I don't see how. They encode
scarcity and using them is relatively expensive. Very few systems
require that. It makes them attractive for the people already invested,
but these properties are antithetical to the process of development.
Successful systems are build from small incremental improvements. That
doesn't seem to happen when the building blocks are a costly chain of
consent.</p>
<p>Option 3, a supernet, is the option that makes sense. A supernet
prevents the data hosts from having too much leverage as they do now. A
supernet doesn't encode scarcity or consent as a core principle in the
way blockchains do.</p>
<p>I hope we can look back at the current era of the internet and
recognize it for what it is. Digital fiefdoms. The step forward is to
pick who lords over us.</p>
<p>Help speed things along. Support the project by registering a LNS
name.</p>
<h1 id="LNS">LNS</h1>
<p>LNS is built on top of linkspace. It reads and writes entries to the
'lns' domain.<br />
It provides a way for naming groups and public keys.<br />
<strong>Groups</strong> look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>#:pub</li>
<li>#:myfancystore:com</li>
<li>#:friendsofbob:local</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Public keys</strong> look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>@:john:lns:org</li>
<li>@:alice:my:fancystore:com</li>
<li>@:john:nl</li>
<li>@:me:local</li>
</ul>
<p>The top level names :local, :env, and :pub are special. The code to
check the validity of a binding works well enough, but there is no
automatic lookup. I plan to build something similar DNS over UDP. You
can take a look on how it integrates with linkspace in the <a
href="./docs/guide/index.html#ABELNS">guide</a>. Registrations are open.
Read this page to find out how.</p>
<h3>What does a registration do?</h3>
<p>It gives you binding right for all sub registration. That means if
you register under @:yourcompany:com you can set up:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>a key addressed with the name @:yourcompany:com</li>
<li>a group addressed with the name #:yourcompany:com</li>
<li>a key to manage registrations for names ending with
*:yourcompany:com</li>
</ol>
<p>I.e. The key with the authority for yourcompany:com can create
bindings for sales:yourcompany:com. That registration can set up a
binding for the key @:bob:sales:yourcompany:com.</p>
<h3>Do I require a registration?</h3>
<p>Nothing in linkspace requires a registration. Everything can be done
without. In fact, <em>:env names you set up for your own use (similarly
to /etc/hosts), and </em>:local are meant for names you share between
peers. Registrations allow you to pick an unambiguous name to be known
publicly, and they support the project financially.</p>
<h3>How can I register?</h3>
<p>The following top level authorities have been assigned, and you can
request a name ending in:</p>
<ul>
<li>:free. First come, first served.</li>
<li>:dev if you have contributed to the code.</li>
<li>:com for 10 euro per year.</li>
<li>:nl for 10 euro per year.</li>
</ul>
<p>To do so, see <a href="#claim">claim a name</a>.</p>
<h3>Can I become a top level authority?</h3>
<p>Yes. I am looking for people and organizations to do so. Contact me
at <a href="mailto:antonsol919+registar@gmail.com"
class="email">antonsol919+registar@gmail.com</a> for more information.
If you represent a university you can get your name for free.</p>
<h3>Can I buy with crypto? Why not use crypto to do X, Y, Z ?</h3>
<p>Linkspace is easy to integrate with blockchains (or can be used to
create new blockchains). You are free to build on it as you wish
(MPL-2.0 license). However, in an effort to put food on the table and
pay taxes I prefer fiat money and a microtransactions save a lot of
trouble w.r.t. identification if you lose the private key. Other top
level authorities set their own price and how to pay it.</p>
<h2 id="claim">Claim a name</h2>
<p>This currently requires a some work. To make a :free claim get the
git repository, install rust and:</p>
<pre class="terminal"><code>make install-lk
lk --init key --key &#39;YOUR_NAME:local&#39; | tee enckey
lk lns create-claim &#39;YOUR_NAME:free&#39; --copy-from YOUR_NAME:local --until [now:+99Y] | tee lnsreq.lkp | lk p</code></pre>
<p>Keep the file 'enckey' (and the password you entered) safe. Email the
lnsreq.lkp file to <a href="mailto:antonsol919+lns@gmail.com"
class="email">antonsol919+lns@gmail.com</a>. I plan to accept :free name
requests until some clown automatically applies for all common names.
After which I'll probably put up a proof of work fence with some
additional constraints on the name.</p>
<p>Get a pull request accepted, and you get a :dev name.</p>
