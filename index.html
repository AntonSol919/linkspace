<pre class="definition"><code>Supernet  [ˈsü-pərˌnet]
A self-referential multi-participant data organization protocol whose primary
addressing method uses hashes instead of endpoint identifiers.
A communication protocol where the method of exchange is an extraneous concern.
e.g. git, bitcoin, nostr, linkspace</code></pre>
<p>In a supernet anybody can talk <em>about</em> data, instead of
talking <em>at</em> a server.</p>
<p>A supernet is ideal when multiple participants want to own and
administrate (part of) a digital system. This is in contrast to current
technologies where users contact a single host, which acts as de facto
administrator by virtue of hosting the data.</p>
<p>Linkspace is a supernet with the following highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small and powerful API</li>
<li>Fast (Blake3, no JSON/Base64 encoding, well aligned fields)</li>
<li>Path (URL like) addressable data</li>
<li>Group/Domain split</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the <a href="#basics">Basics</a> for an introduction. <a
href="#download">Download</a> to give it a try and say hi on the test
group. Check out the <a href="./docs/guide/index.html">Guide</a> if
you're up for some programming.</p>
<p>The packet format and their order on disk are stable, but expect some
unimplemented features and rough edges.</p>
<h1 id="basics">Basics</h1>
<p>In the 1960s we invented the electronic hierachical filesystem.
Organizing files in folders. For example
"/linkspace/homepage/index.html". This proved extremely powerful. So
much so, that the Web (specifically HTTP) is essentially nothing more
than a way to talk to file systems around the world. i.e. <a
href="http://antonsol919.github.io/linkspace/index.html">"https://antonsol919.github.io/linkspace/index.html"</a>.
Linkspace takes this a step further.</p>
<p>To understand linkspace let's look at an example of a message board.
Initially it only contains someone complaing about a coffee machine.
Someone else starts a thread about tabs vs spaces.</p>
<p>The two are merged together to create the new state of the message
board.</p>
<div class="entrygrid small"><span></span>

<span>fix pls? image/Broken.jpg</span>

<span></span>
<span>/thread/Tabs or spaces/msg</span>
<span>Are we still doing this?</span>

</div>
<p>We'll call "image/Broken.jpg" a <strong>path</strong> pointing to
[image data]. One or more of these entries, a path + data, in a (sorted)
hierachical set together we'll call a <strong>tree</strong>. We just saw
what happens when we merge trees. The internet as we know it is built on
them. There are millions of hosts (i.e. servers) that serve such a tree,
receive new entries, and do some processing.</p>
<p>This is more true than might be aparent. It's not
<strong>just</strong> HTTP. For example, an SQL database is a special
case of a tree. It is built on top of multiple sorted lists under table
names. Essentially their rows are "/table<em>name/primary</em>key =
value", and a SQL query can address multiple entries.</p>
<p>Sending data can be thought of as combining <strong>your
tree</strong> with <strong>another tree</strong>. We've dubbed words to
describe specific cases such as: '<strong>creating posts</strong>',
'<strong>uploading image</strong>', '<strong>upvote/like a
post</strong>', '<strong>stream a video </strong>', etc. Fundamentally
they can be viewed as merging trees.</p>
<p>The majority of the internet that people interact with today follows
a single host design. A design where you make a request to get the only
'real' copy of the tree. For all its simplicity, this design has
downsides. It becomes a single point of failure, links can become
invalid, everybody has to re-invent authentication, every application
has to re-invent dealing with IO errors, etc. There are also profound <a
href="#why">consequences</a> for the dynamic between host and user.</p>
<p>In linkspace there is no single 'real' copy, and thus no de facto
administrator. Any number of participants can host (part of) a tree.</p>
<p>That does mean there is no way to uniquely identify an entry with
only a path. Two computers far apart can write to the same location at
the same time. No one would know until their trees get merged.</p>
<p>In linkspace we allow more than one entry to have the same path. Each
entry is cryptograhpically hashed, i.e. there exists a unique number to
reference the entry.</p>

<p>An entry also carries a creation date, and <strong>can</strong> be
cryptographically signed. These cryptographic public keys look like
[b:0XITdhLAhfdIiWrdO8xYAJR1rplJCfM98fYb66WzN8c], but we can refer to
them by <a href="#LNS">lns</a> name such as [@:anton:nl].</p>
<p>When reading from the tree, requesting by path returns multiple
entries. By default, the first result is the latest, unsigned entry.</p>
<p>An upside of using hashes, is that we can choose to link to other
data by its path (e.g. "image/Broken.jpg") or by its hash:</p>

<p>Entries in linkspace have two fields that preceed the path. A
<strong>domain</strong> field and <strong>group</strong> field.
Essentially each (domain, group) has its own tree. A developer using
linkspace picks a domain name and builds his app to read and write
entries in the tree. A domain app doesn't need to manage connections to
other servers. It communicates by reading and writing to the tree. The
group indicates the set of intended recipients. An application should
ask the user which group to use. A group is made up by one or more
members that have set up a method of exchange.</p>

<p>These are the basic concepts. With the most notable simplification
being that: <a href="./docs/guide/index.html#lk_datapoint">Data
entries</a> without a path, group, domain, etc exists as well.
Referencing other packets by hash is not done inside the data but <a
href="./docs/guide/index.html#lk_linkpoint">adjacent</a>.</p>

details on the exact layout of the tree and other practical stuff see

<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>A few notes to prevent some confusion.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: Is this a blockchain?<br />
<strong>A</strong>: Only if you think git is a blockchain. There are
neither 'blocks', nor a strict 'chain'. I consider blockchains to have a
different set of <a href="#option2">values</a>. Which is why I'm
proposing the term 'supernet'.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: How would it handle unwanted content /
spam?<br />
<strong>A</strong>: Someone can sign a list of 'accepted' entries, and
you could filter based on that. Effectively emulating the current state
of affairs, and thus no worse than current systems. Instead, we have
extra tools. Proof of work on hashes, and proof of association with
public keys. AI is driving the cost of bullshit to 0. I expect these
options to become more important.</p>
<h1 id="why">Why?</h1>
<p>This protocol came to be for two reasons.</p>
<p>Reason 1: I found it overly complex to build multi-participant
systems.</p>
<p>A project starts and ends with a vision for what the user should
experience and do. That's difficult enough. Instead, development also
has to deal with managing a server, networking, identity, and access. In
linkspace I've tried to decouple these things. A group, once set up can
run any domain app. A domain app can run in any group.</p>
<p>Reason 2: I wanted to address a key question that underpins how our
society uses digital systems.</p>
<p><strong>Who gets to <strong>administrate</strong> the cat videos,
taxi service, messages, and other data we share and see
online?</strong></p>
<p>I know three options:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Dedicated hosts, exclusively on their machines. This is how most of
the internet currently works.</li>
<li>A pay2play scheme, on a blockchain.</li>
<li>Users pick their admins, on a supernet.</li>
</ol>
<p>In Option 1, our current web, the host has unilateral control. The
current systems have evolved with one goal: optimal exploitation of
their users. Everything is permitted to keep it that way.
<strong>lock-in</strong> the users, and <strong>lock-out</strong> any
threat to the platform's place in your life.</p>
<p>We should break these locks.</p>
<p>Dedicated hosts have a role to play. But users can only get a good
deal if they <em>could</em> walk away without losing what is already
there.</p>
<p><span id="option2">Option 2</span> , blockchains. They are hyped to
be many things, and some people believe blockchains will be the
foundation of our digital space going forward. I don't see how. They
encode scarcity and using them is relatively expensive. Very few useful
systems require that. It makes them attractive for the people already
invested, but these properties are antithetical to the process of
development. Successful systems are build from small incremental
improvements. The return on investment on blockchains projects suggest
that doesn't happen when the building blocks require a complex chain of
consent.</p>
<p>Option 3, a supernet, is the option that makes sense. A supernet
prevents the data hosts from gaining all the leverage as they have in
our current system. A supernet doesn't encode scarcity or consent as a
core principle in the way blockchains do.</p>
<p>This era of digital dictatorships and fiefdoms needs to end. Help
speed things along. Support the project by <a
href="#LNS">registering</a> a name.</p>
<h1 id="LNS">LNS</h1>
<p>LNS is built on top of linkspace. It reads and writes entries to the
'lns' domain.<br />
It provides a way for naming groups and public keys.<br />
<strong>Groups</strong> look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>#:pub</li>
<li>#:myfancystore:com</li>
<li>#:friendsofbob:local</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Public keys</strong> look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>@:john:lns:org</li>
<li>@:alice:my:fancystore:com</li>
<li>@:john:nl</li>
<li>@:me:local</li>
</ul>
<p>The top level names :local, :env, and :pub are special. It is mostly
working working, but I plan to build a dedicated exchange method for
fast lookup of unknowns (recursive UDP similarly to DNS). You can take a
look on how it integrates with linkspace in the <a
href="./docs/guide/index.html#ABELNS">guide</a>. Registrations are open.
Read this page to find out how.</p>
<h3>What does a registration do?</h3>
<p>It gives you binding right for all sub registration. That means if
you register under @:yourcompany:com you can set up:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>a key addressed with the name @:yourcompany:com</li>
<li>a group addressed with the name #:yourcompany:com</li>
<li>a key to manage registrations for names ending with
*:yourcompany:com</li>
</ol>
<p>I.e. The key with the authority for yourcompany:com can create
bindings for sales:yourcompany:com. That registration can set up a
binding for the key @:bob:sales:yourcompany:com.</p>
<h3>Do I require a registration?</h3>
<p>Nothing in linkspace requires a registration. Everything can be done
without. In fact, both :env and :local are meant for naming things for
only yourself or between peers respectively and require no registration
whatsoever. Registrations allow you to pick a name to be known publicly
for everybody.</p>
<h3>How can I register?</h3>
<p>The following top level authorities have been assigned, and you can
request a name ending in:</p>
<ul>
<li>:free. First come, first served.</li>
<li>:dev if you have contributed to the code.</li>
<li>:com for 10 euro per year.</li>
<li>:nl for 10 euro per year.</li>
</ul>
<p>To do so, see <a href="#claim">claim a name</a>.</p>
<h3>Can I become a top level authority?</h3>
<p>Yes. I am looking for people and organizations to do so. Contact me
at <a href="mailto:antonsol919+registar@gmail.com"
class="email">antonsol919+registar@gmail.com</a> for more information.
If you represent a university you can get your name for free.</p>
<h3>Can I buy with crypto? Why not use crypto to do X, Y, Z ?</h3>
<p>Linkspace is easy to integrate with blockchains (or even create a new
blockchain). You are free to build don'g it as you wish (MPL-2.0
license). However, in an effort to put food on the table and pay taxes I
prefer fiat money. Additionally, 1 cent transactions save a lot of
trouble w.r.t. identification if you lose the private key.</p>
<h2 id="claim">Claim a name</h2>
<p>This currently requires a some work. To make a :free claim get the
git repository, install rust and:</p>
<pre class="terminal"><code>make install-lk
lk --init key --key &#39;YOUR_NAME:local&#39; | tee enckey
lk lns create-claim &#39;YOUR_NAME:free&#39; --copy-from YOUR_NAME:local --until [now:+99Y] | tee lnsreq.lkp | lk p</code></pre>
<p>Keep the file 'enckey' (and the password you entered) safe. Email the
lnsreq.lkp file to <a href="mailto:antonsol919+lns@gmail.com"
class="email">antonsol919+lns@gmail.com</a>. I plan to accept :free name
requests until some clown automatically applies for all common names.
After which I'll probably put up a proof of work fence with some
additional constraints on the name.</p>
<p>Get a pull request accepted, and you get a :dev name.</p>

<p>Linkspace is currently an unfunded project, and is missing some key
<a
href="https://github.com/AntonSol919/linkspace/blob/main/dev/TODO.md">features</a>.
Meaning I still do other stuff for food, and won't be available all the
time.</p>
<p>Please contact me directly if you're interested in supporting the
project. Or if you want to talk about specific applications.</p>
<h3>Contact</h3>
<p>Of course the preferred way is to try and contact me on the test
server. For the less adventurous you can use <a

<h3>Trademark</h3>
<p>linkspace is a pending trademark of R.A.I.T. Solutions. Once
registered I will likely use similar terms as git uses for its
trademark.</p>
