<p>This protocol came to be for two reasons. I found it overly
complicated (oppose to simple - not easy) to build multiuser systems. A
project starts and ends with a vision for what the user should
experience and do. That’s difficult enough. Instead, development also
has to deal with managing a server, networking, identity, and access. In
linkspace I’ve tried to decouple these things. A group, once setup can
run any domain app. A domain app can run in any group.</p>
<p>The second is to provide an answer to an issue we’ve all noticed in
some form or another. I see it as such; We face a question on the rules
for our the digital space. Its answer underpins how our society
works:</p>
<p><strong>Who gets to <strong>administrate</strong> which cat videos,
taxi service, or (political) message we share and see
online?</strong></p>
<p>I know three options:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Dedicated hosts, exclusively on their machines.</li>
<li>A pay2play scheme, on a blockchain.</li>
<li>Users pick their admins, on a supernet.</li>
</ol>
<p>See <a href="./basics.html">Basics</a> how 1 and 3 differ.</p>
<p>An analogy would be: A medieval peasant wasn’t entirely limited in
switching between preachers. But among the best ideas we ever had, was
to have anyone read and write.</p>
<p>Option one is unilateral control over content. These systems have
evolved with one goal: Optimal exploitation of the guest and their
attention. Everything is permitted to keep it that way.
<strong>lock-in</strong> the guests, and <strong>lock-out</strong> any
threat to the platform’s place in your life.</p>
<p>We should break those locks.</p>
<p>Dedicated hosts still have a role to play. But users only get a good
deal if they <em>could</em> walk away without losing what is already
there.</p>
<p>The era of digital dictatorships and fiefdoms needs to end. Normalcy
of those rules as the bedrock of most communication is bad. Help speed
things along. Support the project by <a
