      <p>These are exciting times. More than 2<sup>32</sup> people have
      digitally connected, and how we network is due an upgrade.</p>
      <h2 id="the-internet-of-streams">The internet of streams</h2>
      <p>The digital world you know is built on structuring streams of
      data. At its core the internet<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> attempts to
      provide a model where:</p>
      <p>For any two connected devices running any application, there
      exists a connection to transmit data.</p>
      <p>To do this it uses the following types of packets to transmit
      data between two devices.</p>
      <div class="container">
      <table style="width:99%;">
      <colgroup>
      <col style="width: 16%" />
      <col style="width: 22%" />
      <col style="width: 60%" />
      </colgroup>
      <thead>
      <tr class="header">
      <th></th>
      <th>Field</th>
      <th>Purpose</th>
      </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
      <tr class="odd">
      <td rowspan="4">Internet Packet</td>
      <td>IP ADDRESS</td>
      <td>Address for a device</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="even">
      <td>PORT</td>
      <td>A number to address an application on a device</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="odd">
      <td>SEQUENCE ID</td>
      <td>A number to (re)order packets when they arrive out of
      order</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="even">
      <td>DATA</td>
      <td>Set by application</td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
      </table>
      </div>
      <p>Packets are transmitted and - using the <code>IP address</code>
      - they reach their destination; a device such as the one you’re
      using right now. On the device an application is running that
      waits for packets with a specific <code>port</code> to arrive.</p>
      <p>In transit, a packet can get lost or corrupted. The result is
      that packets don’t arrive in the order they were sent. By adding a
      sequence number, the destination can verify all packets have
      arrived and reorder them to the order they were sent in.</p>
      <p>I imagine the proto-internet was first discovered when people
      realized that packet SEQUENCE IDs are essential complexity. When
      transmitting data, something must define the order of packets. As
      a consequence, the physical route each packet takes is
      irrelevant.</p>
      <p>The result is that <em>conceptually</em> each application on
      each device can talk to any other application on any other
      device.</p>
      <p>This model is ideal for phone-calls or video streams. To build
      more interesting applications we create protocols to add further
      structure to the stream of data. There are thousands of different
      protocols, but what most of them have in common is a way to
      transmit questions and answers.</p>
      <p>A couple of well known variants that have this property
      are:</p>
      <table>
      <thead>
      <tr class="header">
      <th>System</th>
      <th>Question</th>
      <th>Answer</th>
      </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
      <tr class="odd">
      <td>DNS</td>
      <td>archive.org</td>
      <td>207.241.224.2</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="even">
      <td>HTTP</td>
      <td>/forum/index.html</td>

      <td>In a supernet […]</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="even">
      <td>SQL</td>

      <td>A message in a db</td>
      </tr>

      <p>At first we used these tools to create websites to provide
      information. But this has grown into interactive ‘platforms’.
      Services that store, forward, and administrate information such
      that multiple devices, and thus people, can communicate.</p>
      <p>One reason for building linkspace is this:</p>
      <p><b>We have reached the limit of using this model of streaming
      questions/answers paradigm for multi-party communication.</b></p>
      <p>First, the stream abstraction can leak. Streams get
      disconnected, one side is overloaded or errors, etc.</p>
      <p>Then, when more than two devices are involved the leaks
      compound. Synchronization is as slow as the slowest link, answers
      become stale or bad, and assumptions that an application relies on
      are no longer true.</p>
      <p>Alternatively you built a supernet.</p>
      <div class="definition">
      <p>Supernet [ˈsü-pərˌnet]<br> A self-referential multi-participant
      data organization protocol whose primary addressing method uses
      hashes instead of endpoint identifiers.</p>
      <p>e.g. git, bitcoin, linkspace</p>
      </div>
      <p>Once you start thinking in terms of supernets, it becomes clear
      that many problems with streaming questions/answers are accidental
      complexity. Using a supernet to build an application those
      problems become irrelevant or trivial<a href="#fn2"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> - and we can do things that
      are practically impossible if we keep talking streams.</p>
      <h2 id="linkspace">Linkspace</h2>
      <p>Linkspace attempts to provide a model where: for any group
      running any application, there exists a space to address data<a
      href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
      <p>If the current internet is streams for key-value systems, so
      you can talk <em>to</em> server, then linkspace is a shared
      key-value space, so groups can talk <em>about</em> data.</p>
      <p>A unit in linkspace is called a <strong>point</strong>. Each
      point has data, some auxiliary fields, and is uniquely identified
      by its hash.</p>
      <p>To understand what each field does lets start with a simple
      example of a message forum.</p>

      <p>The “image/BrokenMachine.jpg” is called a <strong>path</strong>
      and maps to (image data). So far this should look familiar as it
      is similar to files in directories. I’ll refer to each entry as a
      <strong>point</strong>, and multiple entries as a
      <strong>set</strong>. The example shown has two sets
      <strong>merging</strong>. The result is a new set with 3
      messages.</p>
      <p>One of the most useful aspects of linkspace is a way to talk
      and think about digital communication in terms of a set of points
      instead of connections.</p>
      <p>Practically any digital communication can be understood as
      merging sets of points.</p>
      <p>Online platforms have dubbed different words for actions you
      can take: ‘<em>creating posts</em>’, ‘<em>uploading image</em>’,
      ‘<em>upvote/like a post</em>’, ‘<em>stream a video</em>’, etc.
      Fundamentally they can be understood as a frontend application
      providing an interface to merge sets of points. Either on your
      device or “in the ☁cloud☁️️” (i.e. on their device).</p>
      <p>The internet in use today has a single host design. For
      instance, a web-browser or app contacts
      <code>http://www.some_platform.com</code> for the key
      <code>/image/BrokenMachine.jpg</code> to get an image.</p>
      <p>This is relatively straight forward, but it has downsides.</p>
      <p>A host can get disconnected, you can’t (re)share and (re)use
      your copy of the data, there is a misconception on what an address
      is<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, and there is no standard on
      what happens when two people create two different
      <code>image/BrokenMachine.jpg</code> but with different
      pictures.</p>
      <p>This might seem benign, but it has an enormous complexity
      cost.</p>
      <p>With a single host design every server can define (and edit)
      what the ‘real’ copy of the data and its address is. Consequently,
      every device/server has slightly different semantics on how it
      deals with the issues listed - and most are missing basic features
      such as an unambiguous way to address things.</p>
      <p>In linkspace there is no such thing as a ‘real’ copy on a
      single host.</p>
      <p>Every path can refer to multiple points, and every point is
      hashed. There is a 32 byte number that uniquely addresses the
      exact content of that point<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. (which I’ll show
      as <span id="hh0">[HASH_0]</span> instead of typing out).</p>
      <p>It doesn’t matter when or where sets are merged, a set only
      ever has a single copy of a point. It doesn’t matter how you
      received a message or how you send it; If you create a new message
      and refer to the hash, any device can knows exactly what you’re
      pointing to.</p>

      <p>Anyone can uniquely address a specific point by its <span
      id="hh0">[HASH_0]</span>, or multiple entries through a path
      “/thread/Tabs or spaces/msg”.</p>
      <p>This might seem more trouble than existing solutions like a
      filesystem or HTTP. In those, a request using a path gets you a
      single result. But this is not the case.</p>
      <p>In linkspace points have a ‘create’ timestamp and can be signed
      by a public key (which i’ll refer to with [@:…keyname]).</p>
      <p>The single result HTTP or a filesystem provides is an
      incomplete abstraction. It is unable to capture events over time,
      scaling is impractical, and a valid &amp; consistent results is an
      assumption - that can break to disastrous effects.</p>
      <p>In so far as that having a single result is simple; the same
      thing is achieved in linkspace by requesting only ‘the latest
      point with path X’ or ‘the latest point with path X signed by
      someone you trust’.</p>
      <p>The effects of the second option is worth considering for a
      moment: When an application limits itself to points created (or
      linked) by a specific key, then that key has a administrative
      ‘include/exclude’ power, but it is not tied to a physical server
      hosting data.</p>
      <p>Put in different terms - linkspace has the property that
      ‘hosting data’ and ‘data administration’ are decoupled.</p>

      <p>Note that the group and public keys are 32 bytes. For brevity I
      used the <a href="./lns.html">LNS</a> representation for
      <code>[@:alice:sales:example]</code> and <code>[#:example]</code>.
      LNS solves a similar problem as DNS, i.e. instead of using a
      number like <code>192.168.0.1</code> you can use the name
      <code>www.example.com</code>.</p>
      <p>Finally, in our example so far I used a <span
      id="hh1">[HASH]</span> directly in the data field. This would not
      work well for most use-cases. Instead, a point in linkspace has a
      list of <a href="./docs/guide/index.html#lk_linkpoint">links</a>
      adjacent to the data.</p>

      <p>There are some nuances and various advanced topics. However,
      this should be enough to reason about the basics:</p>
      <p>A single unit in linkspace is a point, addressable by hash and
      path, and links to other points. Domain applications provide a
      user interface to read and write points. Users generate their
      identity and form groups to exchange points.</p>
      <p>The result is that <em>conceptually</em> an application only
      needs to process its view of a shared space.</p>

      <h1 id="qa">Q&amp;A</h1>
      <h3 id="who-is-linkspace-for">Who is linkspace for?</h3>
      <p>Linkspace was build to solve a problem for: Me, people who want
      a better internet, and everyone else.</p>
      <p>Starting with that last group:</p>
      <h4 id="the-tool">The tool</h4>
      <p>If you’re just interested in the tool; linkspace can shrink a
      ‘stack’ significantly.</p>
      <p>Data formats change and grow as projects go on. By using
      linkspace to carry the data, many potentially-critical properties
      are there by design.</p>
      <p>Instead of risking a costly and half backed upgrade later, you
      get them without any intrusive design changes required: uniquely
      addressable/cross referencing events, security against tampering,
      logging, cryptographic authenticated and auditable events, low
      effort backups, etc.</p>
      <p>Linkspace can be scaleable decoupled data creation, routing,
      storing, and processing; with data authenticity and user
      authentication to control access, wire up business logic, or log
      ‘who’ did ‘what’ and ‘when’. Take the parts you want and leave the
      rest.</p>
      <p>It even runs in the browser<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, so you can reuse
      more code logic and tools.</p>
      <p>Finally, there is a lot of potential for a ‘network effect’.
      e.g. a support-ticket references the exact IoT event, a sale can
      references the exact history of the object, an ecosystem of
      additional tools that talk (part of) the same protocol, and
      more.</p>
      <h4 id="idea">The idea</h4>
      <p>I build linkspace so I could:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>define, prototype, build, and run real-serverless<a
      href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> apps quickly.</li>
      <li>build an application without having to decide how to
      administrate for everyone that uses it - that responsibility sits
      with the (group of) users.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I believe it can be part of the solution for some of the worst
      problems with the current web.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the greatest insanity of this time (and I would argue
      its defining feature) is a few for-profit advertisement /
      influencing services are the host-administrators of the digital
      ‘public squares’ for more than 2<sup>32</sup> people alive.</p>
      <p>It is questionable for people (and the groups they organize in)
      to be subjected to the interests of an unaccountable
      administrator. But that can be a matter of perspective, as you
      could argue people and groups <em>could</em> reorganize if the
      host-admin misbehaves.</p>
      <p>The hidden cost is far more worrying in my opinion. It is the
      medium as the message: You are not in control, surrender your
      minds for profit and submit to apathy.</p>
      <p>It is a staggering amount of wasted potential for people to
      never experience what it means to build and be a community outside
      the limitations and interest of a
      higher-authority-incorporated.</p>
      <p>We are all lesser for it.</p>
      <p>The message of linkspace should be: You are in control, and you
      should build the best places you can.</p>
      <h3 id="is-linkspace-a-blockchain">Is linkspace a blockchain?</h3>
      <p>No.</p>
      <p>I have no tokens to sell - (But please consider support the
      project by registering an <a href="./lns.html">LNS</a> name. Thank
      you!)</p>
      <p>Blockchains and supernets share a common idea:</p>
      <p>Using cryptographic hashes and public keys to provide a model
      for communication data that transcends the connection used to
      share it.</p>
      <p>Blockchain use the cryptography to batch multiple events into
      ‘blocks’. As new blocks are made they are linked or ‘chained’ to
      the previous block. This creates a consensus of all events that
      happened.</p>
      <p>A blockchain’s goal is to provide a model and tools to make
      consensus simple.</p>
      <p>However, consensus on all events isn’t that useful as a
      foundational feature for the vast majority of applications.</p>
      <p>Supernets don’t bother with a global truth. Their goal is to
      work with the links between packets. Consequently, it’s not
      difficult to define a ‘blockchain’ style consensus in a
      supernet.</p>
      <h3
      id="wont-an-app-have-a-lot-of-overhead-compared-to-a-basic-web-server">Won’t
      an app have a lot of overhead compared to a basic Web server?</h3>
      <p>If all you want to do is stream one movie from a single host
      and forget it, then linkspace might be too much overhead. Few
      projects stay that simple. Most projects grow in scope: to
      identify users, save their comments, add them to groups, scale
      beyond a single server, etc.</p>
      <p>Once a full stack is build, linkspace is very small w.r.t. its
      features.</p>
      <p>As far as speed goes, linkspace point format is designed to be
      fast - Blake3, well aligned fields. The library is zero-copy where
      possible. A single thread on my machine can create new packets at
      a rate of around 800MB/s.</p>
      <h3 id="complexity">Can you ask people to deal with the added
      complexity?</h3>
      <p>Yes.</p>
      <p>Linkspace lacks 6 decades of tooling that made the internet and
      web relatively easy for users, but that can change.</p>
      <p>But is it worth it?</p>
      <p>Yes.</p>
      <p>The height of what we build is set by the weakest foundation.
      Technically supernets better model the reality of multi party
      communication - asynchronous and authenticated<a href="#fn9"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> In the long run it could end
      up with less moving parts and with fewer configurations.</p>
      <p>And finally, I believe it can do some <a
      href="#idea">good</a>.</p>
      <h3
      id="wouldnt-it-be-bad-if-no-one-administrates-what-i-and-others-see-online">Wouldn’t
      it be bad if no one administrates what I and others see
      online?</h3>
      <p>Sure - to some extend.</p>
      <p>There are different ways to do so. The straight forward
      approach is to have the application or user trust the public key
      of someone to scan and whitelist content. This emulates the
      current system of ‘admins’, while still having users give the
      option to replace them.</p>
      <p>Alternatively can be more dynamic. You could have friends or
      friends-of-friends vouch for content.</p>
      <p>I suspect the latter to become more important as AI drives the
      cost of bullshit to zero and while platforms have no incentive to
      identify the engagement and content from chatbots.</p>
      <h3
      id="wont-we-end-up-with-the-same-paradigm-of-highly-centralized-control">Won’t
      we end up with the same paradigm of highly centralized
      control?</h3>
      <p>Maybe, maybe not. If user today could walk away from a
      host-administrator without losing their history, identity, and
      links to others; then they would get a better deal then they do
      now.</p>
      <h2 id="alts">Why not [alternative]?</h2>
      <p>There are two types of systems that can’t do what I want.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Tokens / Synchronizing chains of trust: Is slow and not useful
      for the vast majority of users - (and easy to emulate in a
      supernet).</li>
      <li>Faster email: It’s not that fast and it is using
      server-defined authenticity - plus most of the list below.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Other supernet-like systems are limited in some way or simply
      choose a different design:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Too specialized. E.g. Git has a lot of plumbing for diffing
      text.</li>
      <li>Large ‘packets’ - a hash might refer to gigabytes. This
      requires multiple levels to deal with fragmentation in multiple
      ways.</li>
      <li>Its hashes, without including paths. Linkspace has both as a
      property of a ‘point’.</li>
      <li>Too slow. Packet routing/parsing should be doable in just a
      few instructions - ideally possible in an integrated circuit. It
      should be fast enough to stream video without using a secondary
      protocol to hand off to. That means no json or base64.</li>
      <li>No Groups. Setting who you share with and how is not
      supported, or its little more than ‘run multiple instances’.</li>
      <li>No domains. Everything becomes one app with
      premature-bureaucracy and an ever expanding set of compatibility
      requirements that grinds development/experiments to a halt.</li>
      <li>Its focused on signatures and consensus.</li>
      <li>Poor scripting support.</li>
      <li>Excessively interwoven components. e.g. Transmitting packets
      require a fully running ‘node’ with a fixed method of exchanging
      or saving data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>That does not mean I think alternatives are necessarily worse.
      Different systems have different strong points.</p>
      <p>I think the two things that set linkspace apart from similar
      systems are:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>First class pathnames allow (part of) existing designs to be
      copied ‘as is’.</li>
      <li>All the things it doesn’t do. Linkspace is primarily its point
      format, and secondarily an ecosystem of tools to make it easy to
      build complex things with those points.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Linkspace is free and open source under the MPL-2.0. Give it a
      try next time you want to talk about data.</p>
