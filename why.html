<h1 id="why">Why?</h1>
<p>This protocol came to be for two reasons.</p>
<p>Reason 1: I found it overly complex to build multi-participant
systems.</p>
<p>A project starts and ends with a vision for what the user should
experience and do. That’s difficult enough. Instead, development also
has to deal with managing a server, networking, identity, and access. In
linkspace I’ve tried to decouple these things. A group, once setup can
run any domain app. A domain app can run in any group.</p>
<p>Reason 2: I wanted to address a key question that underpins how
society uses digital systems.</p>
<p><strong>Who gets to <strong>administrate</strong> the cat videos,
taxi service, messages, and other data we share and see
online?</strong></p>
<p>I know three options:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Dedicated hosts, exclusively on their machines. The way it currently
works.</li>
<li>A pay2play scheme, on a blockchain.</li>
<li>Users pick their admins, on a supernet.</li>
</ol>
<p>In Option 1, our current web, control over content is unilateral. The
current systems have evolved with one goal: optimal exploitation of its
users. Everything is permitted to keep it that way.
<strong>lock-in</strong> the users, and <strong>lock-out</strong> any
threat to the platform’s place in your life.</p>
<p>We should break these locks.</p>
<p>Dedicated hosts have a role to play. But users can only get a good
deal if they <em>could</em> walk away without losing what is already
there.</p>
<p><span id="option2">Option 2</span>, blockchains, encodes exclusivity,
scarcity, and have inequality at their <strong>root</strong>.</p>
<p>These properties make it attractive for the people already invested,
but are antithetical to the process of development. A successful system
is born from a simple system. Most simple systems are initially hacked
together to solve a problem, and a developer comes back
<em>afterwards</em> to optimize for utility. That doesn’t happen when
the communication protocol requires a chain of consent.</p>
<p>Option 3, the <a href="./basics.html">supernet</a>, is the option
that makes sense.</p>
<p>This era of digital dictatorships and fiefdoms needs to end. Help
speed things along. Support the project by <a
