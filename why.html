<h1 id="why">Why?</h1>
<p>This protocol came to be for two reasons. I found it overly
complicated (oppose to simple - not easy) to build multi-participant
systems.</p>
<p>A project starts and ends with a vision for what the user should
experience and do. That’s difficult enough. Instead, development also
has to deal with managing a server, networking, identity, and access. In
linkspace I’ve tried to decouple these things. A group, once setup can
run any domain app. A domain app can run in any group.</p>
<p>The second is to provide an answer to an issue we’ve all noticed in
some form or another. I see it as such; We face a question on the rules
for our the digital space. Its answer underpins how our society
works:</p>
<p><strong>Who gets to <strong>administrate</strong> the cat videos,
taxi service, messages, and other data we share and see
online?</strong></p>
<p>I know three options:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Dedicated hosts, exclusively on their machines.</li>
<li>A pay2play scheme, on a blockchain.</li>
<li>Users pick their admins, on a supernet.</li>
</ol>
<p>See <a href="./basics.html">Basics</a> how 1 and 3 differ.</p>
<p>Option one, our current web, is unilateral control over content.
These systems have evolved with one goal: Optimal exploitation of its
users. Everything is permitted to keep it that way.
<strong>lock-in</strong> the users, and <strong>lock-out</strong> any
threat to the platform’s place in your life.</p>
<p>We should break those locks.</p>
<p>Dedicated hosts have a role to play. But users only get a good deal
if they <em>could</em> walk away without losing what is already
there.</p>
<p>Blockchains are in the business of encodes exclusivity, scarcity, and
inequality at its <strong>root</strong>.</p>
<p>In practice they fail to support useful systems, because such a thing
starts its life as a simple prototype hacked together. This gives the
developers freedom <em>after</em> building it to adapt it and optimize
for utility.</p>
<p>Every property of a blockchain that make it attractive for the people
invested, is antithetical to the process of development.</p>
<p>Supernets are the future.</p>
<p>This era of digital dictatorships and fiefdoms needs to end. Normalcy
of the other options as the bedrock of communication is bad. Help speed
things along. Support the project by <a
