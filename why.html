<h1 id="why">Why?</h1>
<p>This protocol came to be for two reasons. The first is developer
hubris. I found it overly complicated (oppose to simple - not easy) to
build multiuser systems.</p>
<p>The second is to answer a question we’ve all noticed by now. I see it
as such;<br />
People must face a question that underpins what society can be:</p>
<p><strong>Who gets to <strong>administrate</strong> which cat videos,
taxi service, or (political) message we share and see
online?</strong></p>
<p>I know three options:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Dedicated hosts, exclusively on their machines.</li>
<li>A pay2play scheme, on a blockchain.</li>
<li>Users pick their admins, on a supernet.</li>
</ol>
<p>(See <a href="./eli5.html">ELI5</a> how 1 and 3 differ)</p>
<p>Option one is unilateral control over content with two goals: Optimal
exploitation of the guest’s attention, and everything is permitted to
keep it that way. <strong>lock-in</strong> the guests, and
<strong>lock-out</strong> any threat to its place in your life.</p>
<p>I fear the idea of liberal democratic autonomy in the public square
does not survive; in a life experienced under irreplaceable remote
administration. Privacy laws do not bar the “message of the medium”. We
can break the locks.</p>
