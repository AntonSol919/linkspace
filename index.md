```definition
Supernet  [ ˈsü-pərˌnet ]
A self-referential multi-user data organization protocol whose primary
addressing method uses hashes instead of endpoint identifiers.
A communication protocol where the method of exchange is a extraneous concern.
e.g. git, bitcoin, nostr, the linkspace protocol
```

A supernet enables us to talk _about_ data, instead of talking _at_ servers.

The Linkspace Protocol's features are:

- Small and powerfull API
- Fast (Blake3, no JSON or base64 encoding, well aligned fields)
- Path (url like) addressable packets.
- Group/Domain split
