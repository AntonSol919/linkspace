* Introduction

Linkspace is a way to structure interlinked data into packets, addressable with a query, in order to build multi-participant applications.
[[../cargo-doc/liblinkspace/index.html][liblinkspace]] is the authoritative implementation.

You should be familiar with the [[../../index.html#basics][basics]].

Projects such as Git, BitTorrent, Matrix, IPFS, and various blockchains already prove that addressing content by hash is a powerful abstraction.
This abstraction sidesteps or solves a number of difficulties inherent in organizing data as streams in applications.
If entries include hashes to other entries I propose to classify it as a supernet[fn::
I consider blockchains a subset of supernets.
They require hashes/entries to be shared, pointing to a previous block, and there are strict rules on what to accept in the chain.].

The issue with supernets build so far is that they are bound to their use-case.
Linkspace is a general purpose supernet.
It is built to be fast and simple.
#+BEGIN_VERSE
Supernet  [ˈsü-pərˌnet]

A self-referential multi-participant data organization protocol whose primary
addressing method uses hashes instead of endpoint identifiers.
A communication protocol where the method of exchange is an extraneous concern.
e.g. git, bitcoin, nostr, linkspace
#+END_VERSE

The supernet paradigm is a trade-off.
Instead of processing ordered streams of network data, an application is a function over the partial view of potentially noisy interlinked state.
This has upsides[fn::
The homepage contains a more about various properties. However, there is one I lack a word for.
Both the process of database-to-view-to-database state synchronization, and dealing with (network) IO in general have this in common:
They're well-designed if they run under the assumption of incomplete/bad state.
In linkspace this is an obvious requirement, and liblinkspace attempts to make it simple.
That's not to imply orchestration becomes simple, or the abstraction does not leak. I fear those are the facts of life.
] and downsides.

liblinkspace is best understood as 4 ideas.

- [[Point]] - Three types of packets
- [[ABE]] - (Byte) templating
- [[Query]] - Query for selecting packets
- [[Linkspace]] - Reading, writing, and reacting to packets

A big addition compared to similar systems is the split between domains and groups.
It separates the responsibility of 'User Interface & Data Structure' from the 'Members and the exchange of data'.
This split and other common problems, are supported by a set of [[Conventions]].

The end of this document contains examples.

* Setup

This guide uses Python and (Bash) CLI snippets.
You can [[https://antonsol919.github.io/linkspace/download.html][download]] them or build it using the latest version from [[https://github.com/AntonSol919/linkspace][git]].

* API overview
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: api
:END:

The liblinkspace API is a small set of functions that is mostly stable.
It is available as a Rust crate ~liblinkspace~ and binding for other languages follow this API.

It consists of the following functions:

- [[Point]] creation
  - [[#lk_datapoint][lk_datapoint]]
  - [[#lk_linkpoint][lk_linkpoint]]
  - [[lk_keypoint]]

- [[ABE]] - ascii byte expressions - a language for manipulating and templating bytes
  - [[lk_eval]]
  - [[lk_encode]]

- [[Query]] - Addressing and filtering of packets with predicates and options
  - [[lk_query]]
  - [[lk_query_parse]]
  - [[lk_query_push]]
  - [[lk_query_print]]

- [[Linkspace]] - Locally indexed packets and new packet processing functions
  - [[lk_open]]
  - [[lk_save]]
  - [[lk_get]]
  - [[lk_get_all]]
  - [[lk_watch]]
  - [[lk_process]]
  - [[lk_process_while]]

- [[Conventions]] - functions
  - [[lk_status_set]]
  - [[lk_status_poll]]
  - [[lk_pull]]
  - [[lk_key]]


* Point
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Point
:END:

#+BEGIN_VERSE
[[../cargo-doc/liblinkspace/point/index.html][Rust docs]]
#+END_VERSE

Points are the basic units in linkspace.
They carry data, link to other points, and might contain information about the who, what, when, and how.
There are 3 kinds of points. datapoints, linkpoints, and keypoints.
A point has a maximum size of 2^{16}-512 bytes.

Building a point is always combined with generating a hash and prepending a netheader.
Together the [netheader, hash, point] form a netpacket.
Functions usually deal with netpacket.

** lk_linkpoint
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: lk_linkpoint
:END:


A linkpoint creates relations between packets by their hash and its location.

It consists of these fields:

| Field_{size}      |                                                    |
|-------------------+----------------------------------------------------|
| Group_{32}        | the intended recipients.                           |
| Domain_{16}       | the intended application.                          |
| Path_{var<240}    | Sequence of bytes. e.g. '/dir1/dir2/thing'         |
| Stamp_{8}         | Big endian UNIX timestamp in microseconds.         |
| Links_{48*n}      | A variable length list of (Tag_{16}, Pointer_{32}) |
| -Link[0]_{48}     |                                                    |
| -Link[1]_{48}     |                                                    |
| -Link[2]_{48}     |                                                    |
| -Link[...]_{48}   |                                                    |
| Data_{var<2^{16}} |                                                    |

A packets' location refers to its (Domain, Group, Path) triple.
All values, including the Path, contain arbitrary bytes.

The max space is shared between the links and data so beware that too much data and links won't fit into a single packet
[fn::To overcome this, just create a new linkpoint, either as a collecting or with a special tag that points to a next linkpoint] .

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Packet hashes, GroupID's, and public keys are 32 bytes.
They are usually encoded in URL-safe no-padding base64, e.g. ~RD3ltOheG4CrBurUMntnhZ8PtZ6yAYF~.
These hashes quickly make things unreadable.
The ~[...]~ syntax ([[ABE]]) allows us to name and manipulate bytes.
This following example shows that ~[#:pub]~ resolves to the bytes ~RD3ltOheG4CrBurUMntnhZ8PtZ6yAYF~ in both the Group and the second link
Furthermore, If no group was provided it defaults to ~[#:pub]~
#+END_VERSE

Datapoints do not have a 'create' field, so they get the same hash given the same data.
If we had forced a specific 'create' stamp for both the python and bash example it would have produced the same hash for both.
Instead, 'create' defaults to the current time ( microseconds since epoch ), and thus the hash is different.

#+begin_ctabs
#+begin_sh

The command ~lk link~ builds a linkpoint packets and output's it to stdout by default.
Whenever a cli commands deal with (domain, group, path) tuples, they are set from the first argument: ~DOMAIN:GROUP:PATH~.
Here two links are added with the tags ~first_tag_1~ and ~another_tag~


#+BEGIN_SRC bash :session cli0 :exports both :results output verbatim
  lk link "a_domain:[#:pub]:/dir1/dir2/thing" \
            -l first_tag_1:RD3ltOheG4CrBurUMntnhZ8PtZ6yAYF_C1urKGZ0BB0 \
            -l another_tag:[#:pub] \

The API deals with arbitrary bytes, not encoded strings.
In python, we have 4 common ways to get bytes.

- ~"some string".encode()"~
- the ~b"byte notation"~
- fields like ~apkt.group~, ~apkt.hash~ ~apkt.domain~ etc
- evaluate an ABE string with [[lk_eval]].

** lk_keypoint 
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: lk_keypoint
:END:

A key point is a linkpoint with an additional publickey and signature.

There are functions to generate, encrypt, and decrypt a linkspace key.
Leaving you to deal with the saving.
Alternatively there is the [[lk_key]] function that does it all for you.
With the added benefit that you can address your own public key as ~[@:me:local]~.

** Fields

In python you can access these fields directly as bytes.
Fields are not writable because they are included in the hash.

#+begin_src python :session lkpy :exports both :results value verbatim
  [attr for attr in dir(lk_linkpoint())  if not "__" in attr]
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example

#+end_example

Where comp[0..7] are the path components, 

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Some [[#predicatelist][fields]] we've not seen so far are writable, but they are not relevant for most applications.
#+END_VERSE


** Notes

Groups signals the intended set of recipients.
Domains signal the activity, and practically the application used to present an interface to the user.

The groups bytes are simply chosen and membership is enforced by its members.
They exist because we say they exist.
It's up to the user (or some to be build management tool) to pick a method of data exchange.
Group bytes can be chosen to have a special meaning, such as public key or a pointer to a list of publickeys that act as group administrators.

The following do have a meaning.
The [0;32] null group ( ~[#:0]~ ), i.e. the local only group, is never transmitted to other devices and is never accepted from outside sources.
Everything in the ~[#:pub]~ group[fn:: the hash of ~lk_datapoint(b"Hello, Sol")~] is meant for everybody. e.g. the public.

By convention the group created by pubkey1 XOR pubkey2 forms a group with those keys as its only two members.

#+BEGIN_VERSE
The ~[#:...]~ is part of the [[LNS]].
A public registry for assigning names and naming rights.
e.g. ~[#:sales:mycomp:com]~ for groups and ~[@:alicekey:mycomp:com]~ for keys.
#+END_VERSE


** lk_write and lk_read
The vast majority of developers should not have to deal with IO and the byte representation of packets.
Unless you're writing an exchange process.

* ABE
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: ABE
:END:

#+BEGIN_VERSE
[[../cargo-doc/liblinkspace/abe/index.html][Rust docs]]
#+END_VERSE

ABE (Ascii-Byte-Expr) is a tiny byte templating language.
A stringly representation of delimited bytes.  
Its primary purpose is to make it easy for developers to read and write sequences of arbitrary (0..=255) bytes in plain ascii.
In addition, it supports evaluation of functions that act as shorthand for long sequences of bytes. 

Linkspace has no concept of encoding.
Fields have a fixed length or prefix their exact length.
The ~null~ (0) byte is not special.

ABE is used for things like [[Query]] or simply [[DEFAULT_FMT][printing]] to talk about these bytes.

ABE is not meant to be a proramming language!
It's primarily meant to read and write arbitrary bytes in some context and quickly beat them into a desired shape.
Some things are limited by design.
Prefer to use the language you're developing in.

When building an application its up to the developer to define what the bytes in the data, link and path components mean.
And subsequently what the end user sees.

If the goal is to display, you should stick with UTF-8.
But if a value is just bytes, avoid adding an additional base64(bytes).

** Parsing

- Most printable ascii letters are as is.
- Newline and Tab are external delimiters. Separating two blocks.
- ~:~ and ~/~ are internal delimiters. Separating two byte expressions.
- ~[~ and ~]~ wrap an expression
- ~:~, ~/~, ~\~, ~[~, ~]~  can be escaped with a ~\~. (Use ~'\n'~ and ~'\t'~ for newline and tab )
- ~\x00~ up-to ~\xFF~ for bytes.
- ~\0~ equals  ~\x00~,  ~\f~ equals ~\xFF~

We can encode binary into valid abtxt as follows:
#+BEGIN_VERSE
We'll get back to [[#lk_encode][encode]] later. 
#+END_VERSE

#+BEGIN_ctabs
#+begin_bash
#+BEGIN_SRC bash :session cli0 :exports both :results output verbatim :cache no
printf "hello" | lk encode -i
printf "world/" | lk encode -i
printf "nl \n tab \t" | lk encode -i
printf "open [ close ]" | lk encode -i
printf "emoji 🚀" | lk encode -i
#+END_SRC
#+end_bash

#+begin_py
All packet fields are arbitrary bytes, and lk_encode can print them as abtext

#+begin_src python :session lkpy :exports both :results output verbatim
  multiline = """newline
  tab	""".encode()

  lkp = lk_linkpoint(path=[b"hello",b"world/",multiline,b"open [ close ]", "🚀".encode()]) # encode implies utf-8

  print(lk_encode(lkp.comp0),"\t",list(lkp.comp0))
  print(lk_encode(lkp.comp1),"\t",list(lkp.comp1))
  print(lk_encode(lkp.comp2),"\t",list(lkp.comp2))
  print(lk_encode(lkp.comp3),"\t",list(lkp.comp3))
  print(lk_encode(lkp.comp4),"\t",list(lkp.comp4), lkp.comp4.decode("utf-8"))
  
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example

#+end_example

#+end_py
#+end_ctabs
 

** lk_eval

ABE is evaluated by substituting an expressions ( ~[..]~ ) with its result.
For example in ~[u8:97]~, the function 'u8' parses "97" and prints it.
The byte 99 equals the character 'c'.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :session cli0 :exports both :results output verbatim :cache no
lk eval "ab[u8:99]" | xxd
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS[7273b79da3eb3a7a7c65c56794847096c71a4b08]:
#+begin_example
00000000: 6162 63                                  abc
#+end_example

The result of an ABE is a list of (bytes, ?delimiter). 

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :session cli0 :exports both :results output verbatim :cache no
lk eval --json "h[u8:101]ll[u8:111] / world:etc" 
#+END_SRC


Note that bytes are joined after evaluating. In the example this results in the component ~('hello ', /)~.
The delimiters ('\n' '\t' ':' '/') are interpreted depends on the context.
In the top level of the template given to ~lk eval~ they are printed as is.

In other words: ~eval "hello/:[u8:99]\n"~ == ~hello/:c\n~ ,
but within brackets they have a special meaning:  ~eval "hello/:[hello/ \n :]"~ will error.

#+Begin_VERSE
The rest of this chapter goes further in depth.
Understanding ABE in depth is not critical.
With basic knowledge of its purpose, expression substitution (~[..]~), and the ~':'~, ~'/'~ delimiters the reader can choose to
skip to the next chapter [[Query]] and return here for reference later.
#+end_VERSE


*** Sub-expressions

A list of functions/evaluators be found by evaluating
[[Help][[[help]]][\[help\]]].

**** Functions

- ~[fn]~
- ~[fn:arg0]~
- ~[fn:arg0:arg1]~

The arguments are bytes. They take upto 8 arguments.
The resulting bytes are concatenated with their surrounding.
The empty function ~'[:...]'~ resolves to its first argument.

- ~hello [:world]~ == ~hello world~

Arguments are evaluated before application.
~[fn0:[fn1]]~ will call fn1 and use its result as the first argument to fn0.

You can carry results with ~/~.
It uses the result as the first argument to the next function.

- ~[:97/u8]~ == ~[u8:97]~ == ~a~
- ~[:97/u8/?u]~ == ~[?u:[u8:97]]~ == ~97~
  
You can think of ABE functions as a translation of conventional function calling.

| ~[name:arg1:arg2]~              | ~name(arg1,arg2)~                  |
| ~[name:[other_name:argA]:arg2]~ | ~name( other_name(argA) , arg2 )~  |
| ~[other_name:argA/name:arg2]~   | ~name ( other_name(argA) , arg2 )~ |


#+BEGIN_VERSE
Functions are aware if they are first or not.
The vast majority of functions do not care.
#+END_VERSE

#+BEGIN_VERSE
~[[:u8]:97]~ is explicitly not allowed. Variable function identifiers are conceptually interesting but practically begging for bugs.
#+END_VERSE

**** Evaluators
The second type of operation is calling an evaluator.
Whereas functions are called after their arguments are evaluated.
Evaluators are called without evaluation ~[..]~ expressions.

- ~[/re]~
- ~[/re:arg0:arg1]~
- ~[/re:[fn:arg0]:arg1]~

The ~/re~ evaluator operates on ~:[fn:arg0]:arg1~ without it being evaluatedd.[fn:: similar to some definition of 'macros']

The most common use-case for evaluators is extending the scope.

*** Scope & context

Functions and evaluators are defined in a scope.
The standard scope contains functions to manipulate bytes.
Some scopes require a context.

You can see all active scopes with the help function.

**** Argv

A straightforward scope is the argument vector.

#+BEGIN_ctabs
#+begin_py

#+begin_src python :session lkpy :exports both :results value verbatim
  inp = "Rm9ycmVzdA" # the base 64 encoding of the word "Forrest"
  lk_eval("[0] [1/b], [0]!",argv=["Run",inp])
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
b'Run Forrest, Run!'
#+end_example

#+end_py
#+end_ctabs



**** Packet scope

By providing a packet, the packet scope is added.
This adds operations to evaluate packet fields such as ~hash~, ~group~, ~path~ etc.
These are bytes that you can use as arguments.

e.g ~[hash/?b]~ encodes the hash in base 64.

For convenience all packet fields accept 'str' and 'abe' as a first argument to print them in a default format.
| ~[hash:str]~      | ~[hash/?b]~      |
| ~[group:str]~     | ~[group/?b]~     |

The ~[/links:...]~ evaluator iterates over every link in a packet.
It evaluates the inner scope for each link with setting the ~tag~ and ~ptr~ function.

#+begin_sh
~printf~ is ~eval~ that reads packets from stdin and puts them in scope.

**** Linkspace

Having a linkspace instance in the scope gives you access to functions like:

- ~#~ and ~@~ ( see [[LNS]] ) for named groups, keys, and other data
- ~readhash~

When using [[lk_open]] , the instance is automatically setup as scope.

~readhash~ is considered bad practice, fine to hack something together, but it doesn't give you much room to process errors or async.
But you can do some wizardry combining it with ~[/links]~.

*** Usage notes

ABE expressions evaluate into a list of [ (bytes,?sep) ].
Sometimes each element has a different meaning, e.g. [ ( domain , : ) , (group , _) ] in the CLI arguments.
You can process this list with ~lk_split_abe~. 

But in the majority of cases we don't care about the list and just want a single result.
~lk_eval~ does just that. It interprets the separators as plain characters.

Finally, consider what you would expect to happen when an evaluator takes a ABE expression as its final argument:

- ~[/links:abc[:hello]/world]~
- ~[/readhash:[#:pub]:the pkt:[pkt]]~
- ~[/:hello/world]~
- ~lk link :: --write 'file:./afolder:with/colons'~

The choice was made that if the final argument is an abe expression that will be evaluated, it doesn't need wrapping ~[]~.
Instead, it interprets the entire tail as is.
This reduces the need to escape ':' and '/', but complicating some other expressions.

#+BEGIN_VERSE
We can add an expression to --write arguments
~lk link :: --write "stdout-expr:hello world:/ [hash:str]"~
In case of ~file~ this leaves us in the situation that second argument is the file and the tail of the expression will be evaluated
The simplest way to ignore all escapes is to use empty evaluator ~[/:..]~. 
~lk link :: --write "file-expr:[/:./afolder:with/colons]:hello world:/ [hash:str]"~

#+BEGIN_VERSE
The following naming conventions are used:

- ending with '?' is a predicate to check a property.
- starting with '?' is a basic reverse operation. [u8:97/?u] == 97. Its similar but less powerful then [[lk_encode]] and lacking '[]' brackets.
- b_RADIX_ ( b2, b8, b16 ) 'b' defaults to base64 radix
- u_SIZE_  ( u8, .., u128 ) parse decimal into big endian bytes. ?u interpret as big endian print to decimal

* Query
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Query
:END:


#+BEGIN_VERSE
[[../cargo-doc/liblinkspace/query/index.html][Rust docs]]
#+END_VERSE

A query is a list of predicates and options used to select a set of packets.
An application can use them to read from the local instance with [[lk_watch]] and [[lk_get]].
And also to make a request to an exchange process that will retrieve relevant packets from the group with [[lk_pull]].

** lk_query
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: lk_query
:END:

Queries are newline separated.
Predicates are an [[ABE]] 3-tuple ~field ':' test-operation ':' value~ and constrain the set of accepted packets.
Options are context dependent and start with ':'

A query might look like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
group:=:[#:pub]
domain:=:example
path:=:/hello/world
pubkey:=:[@:me:local]
create:>:[now:-1D]
#+END_EXAMPLE

A predicate can be set multiple times. e.g. We can add a create:<:[now:+1D]
Queries are designed such that you can concatenate the string representation of two queries and get a new query.
If the result can only ever be the empty set an error is returned.

There are only 4 basic test operations.

| Basic Op |                                   |
|----------+-----------------------------------|
| >        | greater eq                        |
| <        | less eq                           |
| 0        | all '0' in value are '0' in field |
| 1        | all '1' in value are '1' in field |

The following are shorthand and resolve to one or more of the basic tests.

| Derived Ops |                          |
|-------------+--------------------------|
| =           | >(val-1) and <(val+1)    |
| >=          | >(val-1)                 |
| <=          | <(val+1)                 |
| *=          | Last n-bytes must eq val |
| =*          | First n-bytes must eq val |

The CLI has various aliases that can act as a guide in creating queries by using ~print-query~.

#+BEGIN_VERSE 
Many cli commands (e.g. ~print-statemnt~, ~watch~ ) take as the first argument a ~domain:group:path:(?depth)~
If no depth is set the path_len is constraint by default.
Except for ~watch-tree~ which sets the depth to unconstrained by default
#+END_VERSE 

Here we look for the domain 'my' , the group [#:pub], with path starting at /hello and with one additional path component.

The ~b2~ function read a binary representation.
The types are: datapoint=[b2:0000_0001], linkpoint [b2:0000_0011], keypoint [b2:0000_0111].
Setting 'group', 'domain', 'path', 'links', or 'create' predicates automatically exclude the datapoint type.
Setting pubkey or signature excludes link and data points.
#+END_VERSE

** More on predicates

#+Begin_VERSE
~group~ requires 32 bytes but will try to parse base64.
~domain~ requires 16 bytes but will prepend '\0' if too few bytes are given
~path~ and ~prefix~ only take the "\=" op, and take spath bytes. I.e. ~path:=:[//hello/world]~, but will accept ~/hello/world~ as well
#+end_VERSE

Besides the fields in a point, predicates also apply to the hash and variable net header fields.
These fields are useful when writing an exchange processes.

The netheader fields can be mutated and are to be used by the group exchange for exchanging routing information.
It is 32 bytes consisting of the following field: 

|              |                               |

The linkspace is a local log and index that one or more processes connect to.
It is the place you save and retrieve data from.
Either by read or watch.
The latter lets you callback for each currently known and future packet matching a specific set of predicates.

Essentially every thread has a read transaction to the database.
This transaction is updated to reflect the latest state through [[lk_process]] and [[lk_process_while]].
You can read one packet with [[lk_get]], multiple from disk with [[lk_get_all]], or current and future packet with [[lk_watch]].

* Conventions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Conventions
:END:
#+BEGIN_VERSE
[[../cargo-doc/liblinkspace/conventions/index.html][Rust docs]]
#+END_VERSE

Conventions are functions built on top of the other linkspace functions.
They provide interop for processes by encoding data into linkspace packets.

Generally they require the caller to also run [[lk_process]] or [[lk_process_while]]

One general conventions is that domains and paths starting with \xff are for meta stuff, such as status queries and packet exchange.

** lk_status_set
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: lk_status_set
:END:
Status queries allow us to communicate if a process exists that is handling a specific type and a specific instance.

The function signature is (~domain~, ~group~, ~obj_type~, ~instance~).

- A request is a packet in the form DOMAIN:[#:0]:/\fstatus/GROUP/type(/instance?) and has no data and no links.
- A reply is of the form DOMAIN:[#:0]/\status/GROUP/type/instance with some data and at least one link.

Note that the packets are in `#:0`.
This function is only for local status updates.

The group argument does not ask inside GROUP, it only signals which group the query is about.
Other processes are meant to answer a request.

The following are statuses that the exchange process should set:

- exchange GROUP process
- exchange GROUP connection PUBKEY
- exchange GROUP pull PULL PULL_HASH

** lk_status_poll
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: lk_status_poll
:END:

Request the status of a `domain group obj_type ?instance timeout`.


** lk_pull
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: lk_pull
:END:
A pull request is made by a domain application and signals the set of packets it wants.
The function takes the query and saves it as: 
~[f:exchange]:[#:0]:/pull/[query.group]/[query.domain]/[query.watch]~

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Note that from a domain's perspective, there is no such thing as 'fully synchronized'.
The most straight forwards way to emulate such a thing is to create 'log' packets that link to
known packets from a single device's perspective.
#+END_VERSE

Pull queries must have the predicates 'domain:=:..' and 'group:=:..', and ':watch'

An exchange process (such as [[#anyhost][anyhost]]) watches these packets and attempts to fulfill it.
The exchange is only responsible for pull requests received when it is running.
The exchange can drop requests when you reuse the 'watch'.
The function returns the hash of the request.

A domain application should be conservative with its query.
Requesting too much can add overhead.

** lk_key
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: lk_key
:END:

Read ( or creates ) an encrypted private key from lns:[#:0]:/local/NAME.
Also writes into the local LNS lookup table such that the public key can be requested with ~[@:NAME:local]~

* LNS
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: lns
:END:

See [[../../index.html#LNS][LNS]] for some general information.
See [[#ABELNS][abe#lns]] for how to use LNS for lookup and reverse lookup.

The LNS system works by making a claim in ~lns:[#:pub]:/claim/test/example/john~ which we'll call ~$Claim1~
A claim can have 3 types of special links.
The first link with the tag pubkey@ has as ptr the ~pubkey~ bytes to use when referring to ~@:john:example:test~.
The first link with the tag group# has as ptr the ~group~ bytes to use when referring to ~#:john:example:test~.
Every tag ending with '~^~' e.g. ~root_00^~ is an authority public key.
An authority has the right to vote for all subclaims. For example the claim ~lns:[#:pub]:/claim/test/example/john/home/~

~$Claim1~ becomes 'live' when a single authority of ~claim/test/example~ creates a vote by creating a keypoint ~lns:[#:pub]:/claim/test/example/john~ with
the link ~vote:$Claim1.hash~. The first claim to get a majority of votes wins.



* Q&A
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: qa
:END:


**** Why Big Endian?
The tree index is in the expected order when using the numbers as path components.
E.g. ~lk linkpoint ::/some/dir/[now]~ will come after ~lk linkpoint ::/some/dir/[now:-1D]~ because ~now > (now - one day)~

**** Every user of my domain app needs X from my server/I want to add advertisements to my domain app.
Hardcode a public key into the app and publish a group exchange service.
There are two primary ways to centralize things with this public key.
Either everybody connects over a single group, or you can exchange over the group: their-key XOR your-key group.

**** I'm not in control of the user! / Anybody in my group can leak data from it!?
I don't make the rules, I just make them obvious.

**** A domain application can write outside its own domain space.
Yes, the current API has no restriction.
Maybe at some point we can effectively restrict processes through wasm or some other access control.
It will take some time before we reached that point.

**** Why not use an SQL backend? / Why invent queries?
That is a complex question.
First off, if you desire to run SQL queries it is relatively straight forward to stream packets into a SQL table and query them.

But SQL isn't magic, and its non-trivial price to pay for something that is not a great fit for a few fundamental problems including:
1) What are the tables peers should have?
2) How to constrain a query as it travels across a group?
   
Both can be solved in a number of ways, but most solutions are quickly going to bloat.
I've tried.

Queries have a few desirable properties.
They handle byte values, and you can concatenate them to get their common subset.

This is a basic domain application example.
Should you build applications in bash? Fuck no.

The purpose of the app will be to create an image collage with multiple people.

The data structure is as follows:

Adding an image is done by creating a linkpoint where the first path component indicates the name of the image.
The tag of the link is a decimal encoded [X, Y] coordinates.
Its ptr is a datapoint packet hash.
Building the collage is done by adding all images to a base image in 'create' order.
