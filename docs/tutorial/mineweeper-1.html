This is the first a <a href="../index.html">series</a> of tutorials to show how to use linkspace from python.
</p>

<p>
We'll follow Bob in his journey.
</p>

<p>
He build the greatest and must impressive game ever.  
Or so he says.
</p>

<p>
He calls it MineWeeper: A Multiplayer minesweeper clone where players take turns. 
</p>

<p>
These knowledge/skills are assumed:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a little bit of python.</li>
<li>Terminal access (You know <code>cd</code> and can google what <code>xargs</code> does if you're interested)</li>
<li>the difference between a string and bytes</li>
<li>What it means to set the seed for a random number generator.</li>
<li>What a hash and public keys is.</li>
<li>You've read the <a href="http://www.linkspace.dev/basics.html">basics</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In linkspace, the responsibilities for things are different to what we're used to.
</p>

<p>
An application developer has drastically fewer responsibilities.
Things like networking, servers, registration, users, groups, and read/write access are all outside the scope of what an application has to deal with. 
The developer doesn't think about managing sockets, but only about:
bytes, linking to bytes, and reading bytes by link or a query such as path names.
</p>

<p>
This tutorial is about that developer, not about the user or the group.

<p>
Bob's game is perfect, but there is a teeny-tiny, little, detail missing.
</p>

<p>
It only works in hotseat mode.
Every player has to be at the same keyboard taking turns.
</p>

<p>
Bob's a friendly guy, but he doesn't want you coming to his house.
Instead, he'll build something, such that others can enjoy his perfect game with their friends over the internet.
</p>

<p>
No problemo.
</p>

<p>
But first, how does the game work in hotseat mode?
</p>

<p>
It asks the user for a list of player names.
Players take turns entering which cell to reveal until someone reveals a mine or no more safe cells exist.

<div class="org-src-container">

After searching high and low for a method to share it with the world, our friend Bob reaches for enlightenment.
</p>


<figure id="org464825b">
<img src="./images/bob-enlightend.png" alt="bob-enlightend.png">

</figure>


<p>
He finds linkspace.
</p>

<p>
A brand new protocol with very few users.
But it has some features he can't get anywhere else and he figures it's the best solution to make MineWeeper a true multiplayer game.
</p>

<p>
With linkspace:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>his (user administrative) workload drops dramatically.</li>
<li>the game will stay playable without him spending a penny. Forever.</li>
<li>user network/account/group problems can be solved once (hopefully by someone else).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Bob might be a little biased. He suffers from PCSSD, or Post Customer Support Stress Disorder.
Made worse by selling one of his livers to pay the AWS bill.
</p>

<p>
Developing linkspace system boils down to:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Gather some bytes you want sent around in a packet.</li>
<li>Optionally: set a path, add links to other packets, sign it.</li>
<li>Save that packet.</li>
<li>Build a query; a list of predicates for a packet (e.g. pubkey, hash, path).</li>
<li>Use the query to react to packets matching it - either from the local db or as they become available.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For Bob, the linkspace library is an abstraction such that all the players share a common tree where he can read from, and write into.
</p>

<p>
For a user of linkspace, Bob's game is just another domain application.
It provides friendly interface reading/writing the bytes that the developer wants to be shared around.
</p>

<p>
Bob recognizes that his game has two distinct phases.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Finding the people to start playing it with.</li>
<li>Taking turns to play the game.</li>
</ul>

<p>
He'll start with 'play the game', and build the lobby system for proposing/joining/starting a game later.
</p>

<p>
He's not set on the details, but every game starts with at least the players knowing:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a list of (player names, pubkey).</li>
<li>number of rows &amp; columns.</li>
<li>mine_rate.</li>
<li>RNG seed.</li>
</ul>

<p class="verse">
In this setup everybody knows the board, but we'll touch on <a href="#org6ee431c">Cheating</a> later.<br>
</p>

<p>
Players can play a game after they agree on those fields.
JSON works well enough.
After some consideration he realized a 'seed' field isn't necessary.
The hash of the packet can fill the role.
He ends up with a packet to start the game with that looks as follows:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgd8df8e8">

    ]
}

<div class="ctabs" id="org1c1cac1">
<div class="info" id="orgbb8c77d">
<p>

</p>

<p>
Bob isn't infallible, so he'll want to test it locally.
The ./emulate folder contains two script to create and connect two instances locally.
It requires tmux to be installed (available in most package managers)
</p>

</div>

<div class="setup" id="org3c16aa0">
<p>

</p>

<p>
You can create an instance with a basic exchange process by opening a terminal and:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">source ./activate # Builds and updates the PATH, set LK_DIR to ./private
# We want to emulate a entire group with multiple instances.
./emulate/host.session.tmux.sh # This creates a new instance in ./private/alice, with its own key, and starts a host process
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Open a second terminal and execute the following to create additional instances that connects to the host.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">source ./activate # to set the path
# creates a new instance in ./private/bob , with its own key key, and automatically connect to the host alice.
./emulate/session.tmux.sh bob # change this name to add multiple sessions
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The bottom panel is the exchange process, the middle panel is watching the log, the upper panel is to run applications.
You can test if the sessions are correctly connected by running <code>linkmail.py</code> and writing a message.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we have to create the game packet and share it.
Eventually this will be done with a <a href="./mineweeper-2.html">lobby system</a>. Right now we create and share it manually to test our program.
</p>

<p>
One method to do so is as follows:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">cd private
# Edit this setup.json by hand to look like the json above.
cat ./*/emulate_name_key &gt; setup.json

lk link mineweeper:[#:test] --data ./setup.json | tee setup.pkt | lk pktf
# Manually save this packet to each instance
find ./ -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d -exec lk --dir "{}" save --pkts ./setup.pkt \;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If properly done the middle panel of each instance should show a new packet.
</p>

<p>
Finally, in each session we can use the upper panel to run:
</p>

</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orge899a45" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge899a45">Multiplayer</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge899a45">
<p>
The outline is as follows:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>open the linkspace instance and a signing key.</li>
<li>Use the hash of the game packet to get the configuration.</li>
<li>Interpret the settings, including a list of [player names,pubkeys].</li>
<li>while not done:</li>
</ul>
<p>
&#x2013; Print the state.
&#x2013; If our turn -&gt; make a choice and save the move info.
&#x2013; Else -&gt; wait for the current player to make a move.
</p>

<p>
But how do we determine whose turn it is?
There is no host to orchestrate, and packets can arrive for each players in a different order. Somebody might cheat :O?
In linkspace ordering some packets is actually trivial.
Adding a link to another packet is proof that one was created before the other.

There are three ways to deal with cheating.

Four if you count Bobs disapproval as an option.

<p>
Keep in mind what is normal today.
</p>

<p>
Opening a game on your phone or browser usually means it connects to a single host.
This host receives your moves, it checks their local hidden state, and return you a result.
In one sense this is better, only the host can cheat.
On the other hand, only the host can cheat and nobody would know about it.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0514618" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org0514618">Who cares?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org0514618">
<p>
The option you should take by default.
Most games <span class="underline">can</span> be cheated, so the upside of making it more difficult has its limits.
</p>

<p>
Scrabble or Chess can use helper tools you can't detect.
Shooter games have aimbots and 'see-through-walls' cheats.
</p>

<p>
Most players are not cheaters, even if they could.
Trusting your peers save a lot of hassle.
For a game like MineWeeper that is usually enough.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org12d85c3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org12d85c3">Emulate host/client</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org12d85c3">
<p>
One option is to emulate a host/client setup.
The first player could act as host and watch for turns and reply with the result.
</p>

<p>
A slight tweak already makes this more fair than what is normal today.
The host could have their game_pkt contain a link to a datapacket with the game field, without actually making it available.
Once the game is done, the host can release the packet and players could check if the host was honest.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org86c8d60" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org86c8d60">Rng-esus died for your sins</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org86c8d60">
<p>
There are a number of ways to define a set of rules that make MineWeeper random without anyone knowing the full mine map.
</p>

<p>
There are two obstacles:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Agreeing on a random value nobody can tamper with.</li>
<li>How to deal with the cell numbers that represent how many mines surround it.</li>
</ul>

<p>
One option to get a random number goes as follows:
Every player acknowledges the turn before applying it.
Once you have every ack packet you can combine the ack.hash bytes to get a random val nobody can tamper on their own.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-python">ack_link = Link("ack",player_turn_pkt.hash)
# Its best to enforce a value for the 'create' stamp so there is less ambigiouty on what the 'correct' packet must look like
ack_pkt = lk_keypoint( create=player_turn_pkt.create, link = [ack_link])~
acked = dict()
def collect_acks(ack_pkt):
    if list(ack_pkt.link) == [ack_link] and ack_pkt.create == ack_pkt.create:
        acked.insert(pkt.pubkey,pkt.hash)
        if len(acked) == players:
            return False

lk_watch(lk,lk_query_parse(q,":qid:acks"),collect_acks)
lk_process_while(qid="acks")
seed = itertools.reduce(lambda xored, hash: xored ^ hash, acked.values())

</pre>
</div>

<p>
That leaves us with the more difficult issue:
</p>

<p>
Showing the number of mines surrounding a cell, without letting cheaters peek into which ones are non-mines.
</p>

<p>
One solution is to postpone determining which cell has the mine.
We add a 'solver'.
Just like a non-cheater, the solver calculates the probabilities of hidden fields based on the revealed cells.
Revealing a cell is then done with the seed we built earlier and the probability is adjusted for what the current state of the board is.
</p>

<p>
Cheating is now impossible.

In the <a href="./mineweeper-2.html">next</a> installment Bob will continue his journey to building the best game ever.
This time by building a lobby system so it's actually playable.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, a little expectation management is in order.
</p>

<p>
Various components and systems required for linkspace are still in their early days.
It Works On My Machine<sup>tm</sup>.
Some tools and standards don't exist yet or are only partially implemented.
</p>

<p>
It's a project to rebuild the internet into something better.
That means taking some steps backwards before going forward.
At the crrent version it has reached the usability of 1980's email.
It works, but its not pretty nor user friendly.
</p>

<p>
That being said, there are currently no breaking changes to Bob's program planned.
And every improvement to other systems improves the experience of using a linkspace application.
