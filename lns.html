<h1 id="lns---lovely-name-system">LNS - Lovely Name System</h1>
<p>LNS provides a way for naming groups and public keys. Groups look
like:</p>
<ul>
<li>#:pub</li>
<li>#:myfancystore:com</li>
<li>#:friendsofbob:local</li>
</ul>
<p>Pubkeys like:</p>
<ul>
<li>@:john:lns:org</li>
<li>@:alice:my:fancystore:com</li>
<li>@:john:nl</li>
<li>@:me:local</li>
</ul>
<p>:com, :dev, :free, :local, :env, and :pub registars are
special/reserved.<br />
The system is operational except for quick UDP resolution. You can take
a look on how it integrates with linkspace in the <a
href="./docs/guide/index.html#ABELNS">guide</a>.<br />
Public registrations are open.<br />
Read this page to find out how.</p>
<h2 id="qa">Q&amp;A:</h2>
<h3 id="what-does-a-registration-do">What does a registration do?</h3>
<p>It gives you binding right for all sub registration.<br />
That means if you register under @:yourcompany:com you can setup:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>a key addressed with the name ‘@:yourcompany:com’</li>
<li>a group name ’#:yourcompany:com**</li>
<li><strong>all</strong> authorities and keys for names ending with
:yourcompany:com</li>
</ol>
<p>I.e. because you own yourcompany:com, it has binding rights to a key
for sales:yourcompany:com Which can create a binding between a public
key and the name @:bob:sales:yourcompany:com In addition to group id’s
and public keys, a registration can carry additional data, such as a
host IP.</p>
<h3 id="do-i-require-a-registration">Do I require a registration?</h3>
<p>Nothing in linkspace requires a registration.<br />
Everything can be done without.<br />
In fact, both :env and :local are meant for naming things for only
yourself or between peers respectively and require no registration
whatsoever.<br />
Registrations allow you to pick a name to be known publicly for
everybody.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-is-a-registration">How much is a registration?</h3>
<p>:free is free. First come, first served.<br />
:dev registrations are given to contributors.<br />
:com is 10 euro per year.<br />
For others read on</p>
<h3
id="can-i-register-a-nameorg-namenl-namexxx-or-other-another-name-not-yet-mentioned">Can
I register a name:org, name:nl, name:xxx or other another name not yet
mentioned?</h3>
<p>For country codes, and other popular top level names not yet
mentioned as special/reserved I’ll accept registrations and sign them.
However, the goal is to give/sell these top level registars to other
organizations. In other words, your registration might be dropped or
re-assigned depending on how it is managed.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-become-a-top-level-registar">Can I become a top level
registar?</h3>
<p>Yes. I am looking for people and organizations to do so. Contact me
at antonsol919+registar at gmail.com for more information. If you
represent a university you can get your name for free.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-buy-with-crypto-why-not-use-crypto-to-do-x-y-z">Can I buy
with crypto? Why not use crypto to do X, Y, Z ?</h3>
<p>Linkspace is easy to integrate with blockchains (or even create a new
blockchain). You are free to built on it as you wish (MPL-2.0 license).
However, in an effort to put food on the table and pay taxes I prefer
fiat money. Additionally, 1 cent transactions save a lot of trouble
w.r.t. identification if you lose the private key. If all you want is to
fund the project contact me directly (see below).</p>
<h2 id="claim-a-name">Claim a name</h2>
<p>To make a :free claim get the git repository, install rust and:</p>
<pre class="terminal"><code>make install-lk
lk --init key --key &#39;YOUR_NAME:local&#39; | tee enckey
lk lns create-claim &#39;YOUR_NAME:free&#39; --copy-from YOUR_NAME:local --until [now:+99Y] | tee lnsreq.lkp | lk p</code></pre>
<p>Keep the file (and the password you entered) ‘enckey’ safe. Email the
lnsreq.lkp file to AntonSol919+lns at gmail.com I plan to accept :free
names until some clown decides to claim the dictionary. After which I’ll
probably make it a little more difficult.</p>
<p>Get a pull request accepted, and you get a :dev name.</p>
