<p>LNS provides a way for publicly naming groups and public keys. Groups
look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>#:lns:org</li>
<li>#:myfancystore:com</li>
</ul>
<p>Pubkeys like:</p>
<ul>
<li>@:john:lns:org</li>
<li>@:alice:my:fancystore:com</li>
</ul>
<p>:com, :dev,:local and :free registars are reserved.<br />
To apply for a new top level registar contact me directly.</p>
<p>LNS is not fully implemented yet.<br />
However you can reserve a name.<br />
Read this page to find out how.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-my-registratiton-do">What does my registratiton
do?</h3>
<p>It gives you binding right for all sub registration.<br />
The keys associated with ‘:org’ can give ‘company:org’ authority.<br />
‘sales:company:org’ authority to name ‘bob:sales:company:org’,
etc.<br />
Every registration can carry additional links &amp; data.<br />
In the future further auxiliary information is likely to be included</p>
<h3 id="do-i-require-a-registration">Do i require a registration?</h3>
<p>Nothing in linkspace requires a registration.<br />
Everything can be done without.<br />
It allow you to pick names to tell others.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-is-a-registration">How much is a registration?</h3>
<p>:free is free. first come first serve.<br />
:dev registrations are given to contributors.<br />
:com is 10 euro per year.<br />
for others read on</p>
<h3 id="can-i-become-a-top-level-registar">Can i become a top level
registar?</h3>
<p>Yes. I am looking for more partners.<br />
They are leased on a first come first serve bases of a 1000 euro p/m (
12000 euro a year ). Alternative deals are negotiable. Just ask.<br />
The income help funds development and i’ll throw in some goodwill
consulting.</p>

with crypto? Why not use crypto to do X, Y, Z ?</h3>
<p>Linkspace is probably easy to integrate with blockchains (or even
create a new blockchain). You are free to built on it as you wish
(MPL-2.0 license). However, in an effort to put food on the table and
pay taxes i believe plain fiat government backed money is currently
better suited for the job then a token representing a stake in spent
electricity.</p>
<h2 id="reserve-a-name">Reserve a name</h2>
<p>To make a reservation clone this git repository, install rust
and:</p>
<pre class="terminal"><code>make install-lk
lk --init key | tee lnskey
lk keypoint lns:{#:pub}:/request/com/YOUR_NAME &gt; lnsreq.lkp</code></pre>
<p>keep the file lnskey safe. Email the lnsreq.lkp file to
AntonSol919+lns at gmail.com<br />
I will accept /request/free untill some asshole decides to claim the
dictionary. After which i’ll probably make it a little more
difficult.</p>
<p>Get a pull request accepted and you can get a :dev name.</p>
