<h1 id="lns---lovely-name-system">LNS - Lovely Name System</h1>
<p>LNS provides a way for publicly naming groups and public keys. Groups
look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>#:pub</li>
<li>#:myfancystore:com</li>
<li>#:friendsofbob:local</li>
</ul>
<p>Pubkeys like:</p>
<ul>
<li>@:john:lns:org</li>
<li>@:alice:my:fancystore:com</li>
<li>@:john:local</li>
<li>@:me:local</li>
</ul>
<p>:com, :dev, :free, :local, and :pub registars are
special/reserved.<br />
To apply for a new top level registar contact me directly.</p>
<p>LNS is not fully implemented yet.<br />
You can take a peek on how it will integrate with linkspace in the <a
href="./docs/guide/index.html#ABELNS">guide</a>.<br />
Reservations are open.<br />
Read this page to find out how.</p>
<h2 id="qa">Q&amp;A:</h2>
<h3 id="what-does-a-registratiton-do">What does a registratiton do?</h3>
<p>It gives you binding right for all sub registration.<br />
The keys associated with ‘:org’ can give ‘company:org’ authority.<br />
‘sales:company:org’ authority to name ‘bob:sales:company:org’,
etc.<br />
Every registration can carry additional links &amp; data.</p>
<h3 id="do-i-require-a-registration">Do I require a registration?</h3>
<p>Nothing in linkspace requires a registration.<br />
Everything can be done without.<br />
You can setup a root [#:…:local] key simple enough.<br />
Registrations allow you to pick a name to be known publicly for
everybody.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-is-a-registration">How much is a registration?</h3>
<p>:free is free. First come first served.<br />
:dev registrations are given to contributors.<br />
:com is 10 euro per year.<br />
For others read on</p>
<h3 id="can-i-become-a-top-level-registar">Can I become a top level
registar?</h3>
<p>Yes. I am looking for people to do so. Top level names are leased on
a first come first served bases, no constraints, for a 1000 euro p/m
(12000 euro a year). Alternative deals are negotiable. Just ask.<br />
I’ll throw in some goodwill consulting if you ever decide to disrupt
some industry.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-buy-with-crypto-why-not-use-crypto-to-do-x-y-z">Can I buy
with crypto? Why not use crypto to do X, Y, Z ?</h3>
<p>Linkspace is easy to integrate with blockchains (or even create a new
blockchain). You are free to built on it as you wish (MPL-2.0 license).
However, in an effort to put food on the table and pay taxes I believe
plain fiat government backed money is currently better suited for the
job then a token representing a stake in spent electricity.
Additionally, 1 cent transactions saves a lot of trouble w.r.t. account
recovery. If all you want is to fund the project contact me directly
(see below).</p>
<h2 id="reserve-a-name">Reserve a name</h2>
<p>To make a reservation clone this git repository, install rust
and:</p>
<pre class="terminal"><code>make install-lk
lk --init key | tee lnskey
lk keypoint lns:[#:pub]:/request/com/YOUR_NAME &gt; lnsreq.lkp</code></pre>
<p>Keep the file lnskey safe. Email the lnsreq.lkp file to
AntonSol919+lns at gmail.com<br />
I will accept /request/free until some asshole decides to claim the
dictionary. After which I’ll probably make it a little more
difficult.</p>
<p>Get a pull request accepted, and you get a :dev name.</p>
