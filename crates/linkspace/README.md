# Linkspace - a general purpose supernet

> Supernet  [ˈsü-pərˌnet]

In a supernet anybody can talk _about_ data, instead of talking _at_ a server.

A supernet is ideal when multiple participants want to own and administrate (part of) a digital system.
This is in contrast to current technologies where users contact a single host,
which acts as de facto administrator by virtue of hosting the data.

[Linkspace](https://antonsol919.github.io/linkspace/index.html) is supernet with the following highlights:

- Small and powerful API
- Fast (Blake3, no JSON/Base64 encoding, well aligned fields)
- Path (URL like) addressable data
- Group/Domain split

Check out [Basics](https://antonsol919.github.io/linkspace/index.html#basics) for an introduction.
[Download](https://antonsol919.github.io/linkspace/index.html#download) to give it a try and say hi on the test group.
Check out the [Guide](https://antonsol919.github.io/linkspace/docs/guide/index.html) if you're interested in the technical breakdown.

The packet and database layout are stable, but some things are incomplete or undocumented.

Any feedback, questions, and ideas for improvements are welcome!

Of course the preferred way is to try and contact me by downloading the zip and sending a message to the test group.
For the less adventurous you can open an issue on github or email me at antonsol919@gmail.com.
