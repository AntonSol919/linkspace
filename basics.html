      <h2 id="the-internet-of-streams">The internet of streams</h2>
      <p>The internet attempts to provide a model where: for any two
      points running any application, there exists a connection to
      transmit data.</p>
      <p>To do this we use the following types of packets.</p>
      <div class="container">
      <table style="width:99%;">
      <colgroup>
      <col style="width: 16%" />

      <col style="width: 60%" />
      </colgroup>
      <thead>
      <tr class="header">
      <th></th>
      <th>Field</th>
      <th>Meaning</th>
      </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
      <tr class="odd">
      <td rowspan="4">Internet Packet</td>
      <td>IP ADDRESS</td>
      <td>Address for a device</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="even">
      <td>PORT</td>
      <td>A number to address an application on a device</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="odd">
      <td>SEQUENCE ID</td>
      <td>A number to (re)order packets when they arrive out of
      order</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="even">
      <td>DATA</td>
      <td>Set by application</td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
      </table>
      </div>
      <p>Packets are transmitted using some piece of hardware, and
      eventually reach a destination <code>IP address</code>, such as a
      phone. At the destination an application is listening for packets
      with a specific <code>port</code> to be received.</p>
      <p>Packet don’t arrive in the order they were sent, the speed of
      light makes this impractical. By adding a sequence number, we can
      reorder them at the destination.</p>
      <p>The result is that <em>conceptually</em> each application on
      each device can talk to any other application on any other
      device.</p>
      <p>This model is ideal for phone-calls or video streams. To build
      more interesting applications we encode our data in a specific
      way. There are thousands of different encodings, but what they
      share is that they transmit questions and answers. Or in other
      words: queries and responses, or keys and values<a href="#fn1"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. i.e. a mapping between input
      and output.</p>
      <p>Over the years we’ve built a thousand different protocols to
      facilitate this design. Some are extremely specific to a use-case,
      some are more generic.</p>
      <p>A couple of well known systems that can map keys to values over
      the internet are:</p>
      <table>
      <thead>
      <tr class="header">
      <th>System</th>
      <th>Query</th>
      <th>Value</th>
      </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
      <tr class="odd">
      <td>DNS</td>
      <td>archive.org</td>
      <td>207.241.224.2</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="even">
      <td>HTTP</td>
      <td>/forum/index.html</td>
      <td>Hello world!</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="odd">
      <td>FTP</td>
      <td>/Projects/linkspace/readme.md</td>
      <td>In a supernet […]</td>

      <tr class="even">
      <td>SQL</td>
      <td>SELECT * from MSG where ID=1;</td>

      <p>The reason for building linkspace is this:</p>
      <p><strong>We have reached the limit of this
      paradigm.</strong></p>
      <h2 id="linkspace">Linkspace</h2>
      <p>Linkspace attempts to provide a model where: for any group
      running any application, there exists a space to address data.</p>
      <p>If the current internet provides streams for key-value systems,
      so we can talk <em>to</em> server,<br />
      then linkspace provides a shared key-value space, so we can talk
      <em>about</em> data.</p>
      <p>A unit in linkspace is called a point. Each point has data,
      some auxiliary fields, and is uniquely identified by its hash.</p>

      </div>
      <p>The “image/BrokenMachine.jpg” is a <strong>path</strong>
      pointing to [image data]. The hierarchical (sorted) set of path +
      data we’ll call a <strong>tree</strong>.</p>
      <p>The example has two trees merging . Merging trees is a powerful
      abstraction.</p>
      <p>Take a website or phone app. We’ve dubbed words to describe
      their specific features such as: ‘<em>creating posts</em>’,
      ‘<em>uploading image</em>’, ‘<em>upvote/like a post</em>’,
      ‘<em>stream a video</em>’, etc. Fundamentally they can be
      understood as a frontend application providing an interface to
      <strong>merge</strong> trees.</p>
      <p>The internet we use today has a single host design. A design
      where applications make request to a specific address in order to
      get the only ‘real’ copy of the tree.</p>
      <p>This is simple, but having only one real copy has downsides. It
      becomes a single point of failure, links become invalid, a copy
      can’t be reshared and reused, and other limits we’ll come back
      to.</p>
      <p>In linkspace there is no ‘real’ copy. Anyone can read, write,
      and host (part of) a tree.</p>
      <p>This does mean we must deal with two entries using the same
      path. Two computers far apart could write to the same location at
      the same time. No one would know until their trees get merged.</p>
      <p>In linkspace the entries, i.e. <strong>points</strong>, can
      share the same path. Each point is cryptograhpically hashed. This
      means there exists a unique number to reference it.</p>

      <p>A point can also carry a creation date, and can be
      cryptographically signed. These cryptographic public keys look
      like [b:0XITdhLAhfdIiWrdO8xYAJR1rplJCfM98fYb66WzN8c]. Eventually
      we’ll be able to refer to them by a <a href="./lns.html">lns</a>
      name such as [@:anton:nl].</p>
      <p>Because we have a hash and a path, we can choose how to
      reference data.</p>
      <p>We can reference a specific point by its <span
      id="hh2">[HASH_2]</span>, or multiple entries through a path
      “/thread/Tabs or spaces/msg”.</p>
      <p>At first glance, returning multiple entries for a custom key is
      more complex than the familiar filesystem or HTTP. This is not
      entirely true. Instead, they have implicitly multiple values per
      key. It depends on when a request is made, or even from where.</p>
      <p>As such, a message board could look like.</p>

      <p>We do want to control who access what, how, and when.</p>
      <p>To do so, points in linkspace have two fields that precede the
      path. A <strong>domain</strong> field and <strong>group</strong>
      field. Essentially each combination of (domain, group) has its own
      tree.</p>
      <p>The group indicates the set of intended recipients. The device
      running linkspace instance run and configure a group exchange
      process to merge trees with others.</p>
      <p>An application picks a domain name. It only has to interfaces
      with the tree. Not with managing connections.</p>

      <p>Finally, using the hash directly in the content of the data is
      not ideal for many reasons. Few data formats have a notion of
      references, and more importantly they’re difficult for machines to
      read. Instead a point in linkspace has a list of <a
      href="./docs/guide/index.html#lk_linkpoint">links</a> adjacent to
      the data.</p>
      <p>There are a couple more advanced topics, such as how paths are
      encoded the <a href="./docs/guide/index.html#Query">queries</a>
      system. But this covers the basic idea behind linkspace;</p>
      <p>Applications reading, writing, and reacting to points as they
      query their domain tree, users joining groups by configuring how
      they exchange points.</p>
      <h2 id="ready-to-try">Ready to try?</h2>
      <p>The linkspace library has a mostly stable API. With the CLI you
      can quickly script a bridge between streams and linkspace, or
      build a new application.</p>
      <p>However, this is still a work in progress.</p>
      <p>If you’re on a unix give it a <a
      href="https://github.com/AntonSol919/linkspace/releases">try</a>
      and say hi on the test group, emulate a local group, or start
      building your own.</p>
      <p>(It runs on Windows, but there is currently no working group
      exchange process.)</p>
      <p>For a technical document regarding the API and CLI see the <a
      href="./docs/guide/index.html">Guide</a>. If you want to support
      the project consider registering a <a href="./lns.html">public
      name</a>.</p>
      <h1 id="qa">Q&amp;A</h1>
      <p>Some common questions and answers about the project in
      general:</p>
      <h3 id="is-linkspace-a-blockchain">Is linkspace a blockchain?</h3>
      <p>No.</p>
      <p>Blockchains and supernets share a common dea:</p>
      <p>Using cryptographic hashes and public keys to provide a model
      of data that trancends the connection used to share it.</p>
      <p>Blockchain use the cryptography to batch multiple events into
      ‘blocks’. As new blocks are made they are linked or ‘chained’ to
      the previous block. This creates a consensus of all events that
      happened.</p>
      <p>A blockchain’s goal is to provide a model and tools to make
      consensus simple.</p>
      <p>However, consensus on all events isn’t that useful as a
      foundational feature for an overwhelming majority of
      applications.</p>
      <p>A supernet simply does not require that kind of consensus.</p>
      <p>With a general purpose supernet like linkspace it is easy to
      implement similar consensus mechanism in an application.</p>
      <h3
      id="wont-a-app-have-a-lot-of-overhead-compared-to-a-basic-web-server">Won’t
      a app have a lot of overhead compared to a basic Web server?</h3>
      <p>If all you want to do is stream one movie from a single host
      and forget it, then linkspace might be too much overhead. Few
      projects stay that simple. Most projects grow in scope to identify
      users, save their comments, add them to groups, scale beyond a
      single server, etc.</p>
      <p>Once a full stack is build, linkspace is very small w.r.t. its
      features. Furthermore, it is designed to be fast/low energy, such
      that you can stream a video on a potato phone. Even single
      threaded:
      <code>dd bs=10G count=1 if=/dev/zero | lk data &gt; /dev/null</code></p>
      <h3 id="can-you-ask-people-to-deal-with-the-added-complexity">Can
      you ask people to deal with the added complexity?</h3>
      <p>Yes.</p>
      <p>Linkspace lack 3 decades of tooling that made the web
      relatively easy for users, but that can change.</p>
      <p>The nature of communication over distance is chaotic and
      asynchronous, so much of the “complexity” is not artificial or
      accidental. Furthermore, the number of configuration could end up
      smaller: Passwords, Groups, friends can be setup once and used by
      every application. Finally, making people responsible isn’t a bad
      thing, being impotent online is.</p>
      <h3
      id="isnt-it-a-good-thing-that-a-host-administrates-what-i-and-others-can-see-online">Isn’t
      it a good thing that a host administrates what I and others can
      see online?:</h3>
      <p>This can be a service that is provided so end users do not have
      to worry about seeing questionable content. Similar to how it is
      done today.</p>
      <p>On the flip side, hosts are currently final and total
      administrators by virtue of hosting the data. Having this as the
      foundational ‘truth’ to how billions of people spend hours each
      day communicating scares the shit out of me.</p>
      <h3
      id="wont-it-devolve-to-the-same-paradigm-of-centralized-systems">Won’t
      it devolve to the same paradigm of centralized systems?:</h3>
      <p>Maybe, maybe not. If a users can walk away from a host platform
      without losing their history, the host has to give a better deal
      than they do now.</p>
      <h2 id="why-not">Why not <alternative>?</h2>
      <p>Some limitations i’ve found are:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>It has either hash addresses or custom url addresses, not
      both.</li>
      <li>Too slow. It should be doable in hardware and fast enough to
      stream video as is. Not hand it over to different protocol.</li>
      <li>No Groups. Consequently there is no or little granularity in

      <li>No domains. Everything becomes one app.</li>
      <li>Its distracted with facilitating digital signatures and
      concensus, instead of focusing on the utility without a
      consensus.</li>
      <li>A blessed/fixed method of exchanging data, instead of a
      external/modular system to be filled in per use case.</li>
      <li>An ever growing set of built in (stream) protocols to
      negotiate a state. (A consequence of the previous point)</li>
      <li>A stagnating set of protocols and thus improvements are hard
      to roll out.</li>
      <li>Poor (bash) scripting/piping support</li>
      </ul>
      <p>That does not mean I think alternative are worse or useless.
      Different models have different strong points, more than one
      supernet can co-exist.</p>
