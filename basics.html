      Just like URL's of the world wide web, linkspace looks a lot like a filesystem.<br>
      To understand the difference, we must first look at merging two sets.

    A web-servers is software that serve such a file/folder tree, receives new entries,
    and does some additional processing<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.
    Your browser requests some of the data in the tree and uses it draw a interface to make it easy to interact with.
    The webserver does not care about those graphics. It only knows about data.

    What happens when two people want to write to the same location? 
    A server would have multiple options.
    After all, it is the only 'real' copy we can point to.
    One option is to only keep one entry, or add a timestamp to the end signaling the date it received the message.
    Without a single host being the 'real' copy, these options don't work. 
    But having a single host is slow, creates a single point of failure, and with that much control by one organization has profound <a href="./why.html">consequences</a>.

    In linkspace two entries can always overlap<br>

    The hash is a unique number for every entry. It depends in part on the content and the path.<br>
    This allows us to merge two trees.<br>
    What is more, we also get the option to pick if we want to refer to things by a path "image/Broken.jpg" or by their hash.

      Linkspace goes further.
      Each entry is set inside a Domain and a Group.
      A domain name is chosen by a developer creating a (graphical) interface.
      The domain name signals what app to use, and thus how the developer organized entries.
      The group is set by the user. It exits because we say it exists.
      Finally, each entry has a creation date and <i>can</i> be signed.

Databases aren't magic. They create multiple sorted lists under table names.
In essence : 'table_name/primary_key=value'
The tree described here is the general case where primary_key has variable length and tables can be nested and (unambiguously) merged.

    With the most notable simplification being that: 
    Packets containing <i>only</i> data <a href="./docs/guide/index.html#lk_datapoint">exist</a>.
    Hash references are not written inside the text.  
    Instead, the entry looks like <a href="./docs/guide/index.html#lk_linkpoint">this</a> so that links are fast to read for computers.
    Finally, addressing by path 'images/Broken.jpg' has a few extra options to select it by time created, signed by, etc.
