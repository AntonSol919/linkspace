<h1> Basics </h1>
<div class="merge">
  <div>
    <p style="margin-top:0px">
    In the 1960s we invented the electronic hierachical filesystem. 
    Organizing files in folder. For example "/linkspace/homepage/basics.html". This proved extremely powerful.
    So much so, that the Web (specifically HTTP) is essentially nothing more than a way to talk to file systems around the world.
    i.e. <a href="https://antonsol919.github.io/linkspace/basics.html">http://antonsol919.github.io/linkspace/basics.html</a>.
    Linkspace takes this a step further. 
    </p>
    <p>
    To understand linkspace lets look at an example of a message board.
    Initially it only contains someone complaing about a coffee machine. Someone else starts a thread about tabs vs spaces. 
    </p>
     <p>
     The two are merged together to create the new state of the message board.

   <p>
    We'll call "image/Broken.jpg" a <b>path</b> pointing to [image data].
    One or more of these entries, a path + data, in a (sorted) hierachical set together we'll call a <b>tree</b>. We just saw what happens when we merge trees.
    The internet as we know it is built on them.
    There are millions of hosts (i.e. servers) that serve such a tree, receive new entries, and do some processing.
   </p>

   <p>
    This is more true than might be aparent. It's not <i>just</i> HTTP. 
    For example, an SQL database is a special case of a tree. It is built on top of multiple sorted lists under table names.
    Essentially their rows are "/table_name/primary_key = value", and a SQL query can address multiple entries.
   </p>
  <p>
    Sending data can be thought of as combining <b>your tree</b> with another <b>tree</b>.
    We've dubbed words to describe specific cases such as:
    '<i>creating posts</i>', '<i>uploading image</i>', '<i>upvote/like a post</i>', '<i>stream a video </i>', etc.
    Fundamentally they can be seen as merging trees.
  </p>

  <p>
    The majority of the internet that people interact with today follow a single host design.
    A design where they make request to get the only 'real' copy of the tree.
    However, this option has downsides<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
    and comes with profound <a href="./why.html">consequences</a> for the dynamic between host and user.
  </p>

   <p>
   In linkspace there is no single 'real' copy, and thus no de facto administrator.
   Any number of participants can host a (part of a) tree.
   </p>

   <p>
   Each approach has upsides and downsides, but a full discussion and the alternatives created since are outside the scope of this document.
   </p>

   <p>
    One obvious issue is that two paths can overlap.
    In linkspace two entries can have the same path. Thus trees can be merged anywhere, at any time.

    Each entry is cryptograhpically hashed. I.e. there exists a unique number to reference the entry.
    A nice property of using hashes is that we can choose to link to other data by its path (e.g. "image/Broken.jpg") or by its hash:

      Linkspace goes one step further.
      Each entry is set inside a Domain and a Group.
      A developer building a application simply picks a domain name, and builds his app to read and write the structure he desires on the entries in the tree.
      A good domain app doesn't touch the internet directly. It communicates by reading and writing to the tree.
      The app should ask the user which group to use.
      The group is made up by one or more members that agree to a method of exchange.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, each entry has a creation date and <i>can</i> be signed by a cryptograhpic public/private key to identify who created a message.

      These are the basic concepts<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.
      If you're on a unix give it a <a href="./download.html">try</a>.
      For details on the exact layout of the tree and other practical stuff see the <a href="./docs/guide/index.html">Guide</a>.

<h3>Q&A</h3>
    <p>
    A few notes to prevent some confusion.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Q</b>: Is this a blockchain?<br>
    <b>A</b>: Only if you think git is a blockchain. There is no strict 'chain', nor 'blocks'. I consider blockchains to have a different set of <a href="./why.html#option2">values</a>. Which is why I'm proposing 'supernets'.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Q</b>: Isn't administration necesary for such and such?<br>
    <b>A</b>: Its relativly simple to organize such that a participant trusts a specific key to act as administrator. The difference sits in having a choice or not.  
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Q</b>: Will it handle spam?<br>
    <b>A</b>: No worse than current systems. Instead, we have extra tools. Proof of work on hashes, and proof of association with public keys. With AI advances driving the cost of bullshit to 0, they'll become a necesity. Will it solve it entirely? A philosphical discussion on the classification of spam is outside the scope of this project.

    With the most notable simplification being that: 
    <a href="./docs/guide/index.html#lk_datapoint">Data entries</a> without a path, group, domain, etc exists as well.
    Referencing other packets by hash is not done inside the data but <a href="./docs/guide/index.html#lk_linkpoint">adjacent</a>.
    Finally, addressing by path 'images/Broken.jpg' would default to a tree set of all entries with that path. There are options to be more specific.
